\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every number in number system is considered as a complex number
\item
  A number of the form \(a+ib\) is called a complex number when \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers and \(i=\sqrt{-1}\).
\item
  For a given complex number, \(a+ib\), `\(a\)' is known as the real part and `\(b\)' is known as the imaginary part.
\item
  If \(a=0\), the number \(ib\) is said to be purely imaginary, if \(b=0\) the number \(a\) is real.
\item
  A pair of complex number \(a+ib\) and \(a-ib\) are said to be conjugate of each other.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Show that the sum and product of a complex number and its conjugate complex are both real.}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/NSbox1a-1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let \(a+ib\) and \(c+id\) be two complex numbers. Then
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Addition.} \((a+ib) + (c+id)= (a+c)+i(b+d)\)

\textbf{Subtraction} \((a+ib) - (c+id)= (a-c)+i(b-d)\)

\textbf{Multiplication} \((a+ib) \times (c+id)= ac-bd+i(ad+bc)\)

\textbf{Addition.} \(\frac{a+ib}{c+id}= \frac{a+ib}{c+id}.\frac{c-id}{c-id}= \frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}+i\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Complex numbers are denoted by \(\mathbb{C}\).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{imaginary-numbers}{%
\subsection{Imaginary numbers}\label{imaginary-numbers}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A number that does not exist in the number line is known as imaginary number.
\item
  For example, square root of negative numbers are imaginary numbers. It is denoted by \(i\).
  i.e \[\sqrt{-1}=i\] \newline
  \[i^{2} = â€“ 1\]
\item
  So there is no real number \(i\) that satisfies the above equation.
\item
  The quantity, \(i\) is called the unit imaginary number.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Geometrical Representation of imaginary numbers}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figure/1-ImgNum} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let OA be positive numbers which is represented by \(x\) and \(OA^\prime\) by \(-x\).
\item
  And \(-x= (i)^2x=i(ix)\) is on \(OX^{\prime}\).
\item
  According to the above expression, the multiplication of the real number \(x\) by \(i\) twice amounts is equivalent to the rotation of OA through two right angles to reach \(OA^\prime\).
\item
  Therefore, the multiplication of \(x\) by \(i\) is equivalent to the rotation of \(x\) through one right angle to reach \(OA^{\prime\prime}\).
\item
  Therefore, y-axis is known as imaginary axis.
\item
  Multiplication by \(i\) rotates its direction through right angle.
\end{itemize}

\item
  A rational number is defined as number of the form \(x/y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are integers and \(y \neq 0\).
\item
  The set of rational numbers encloses the set of integers and fractions.
\item
  The rational numbers that are not integral will have decimal values. These values can be of two types

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Terminating decimal fractions (finite decimal factors): For example \(1/5 = 0.5\) , \(13/5 = 2.6\).
  \item
    Non Terminating decimal fractions. The non terminating decimal fractions having two types:

    \begin{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{i) Non terminating periodic fractions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  These are non terminating decimal fractions of the type \(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmb1b2b3b4b5 .....bm\)
\item
  Examples

  \(19/6 = 3.16666666.....\)

  \(18/7 = 2.57142857142857.......\)

  \(21/9= 2.3333.......\)
\end{enumerate}

\emph{ii) Non terminating non periodic fractions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  These are non terminating and there is no periodic decimal places for that number.
\item
  i.e \(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmc1c2.........\)
\item
  for example 6.789542587436512\ldots{}\ldots{}\ldots{}.

    Decimal number system (Base- 10)
  \item
    Binary number system (Base- 2)

\hypertarget{decimal-number-system}{%
\subsection{Decimal Number System}\label{decimal-number-system}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The Decimal number system is a number of base or radix equal to 10.
\item
  To determine the actual number in each position, take the number that appears in the position and multiply it by \(10^x\), where \(x\) is the power representation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 1: The value of the combination of symbols 453 is determined by adding the weights of each position as}

\[4\times10^2+5\times10^1+3\times10^0\]
\[= 4\times100 + 5\times10+3\times1\]
Or \[= 400+50+3 = 453\]

\textbf{Example 2: The value of the combination of symbols 369.54 is determined by adding the weights of each position as}

\[3\times10^2+6\times10^1+9\times10^0+5\times10^{-1}+4\times10^{-2}\]
Or \[= 300 + 60+9+\frac{5}{10}+\frac{4}{100}\]
Or \[= 300 + 60+9+0.5+0.04= 369.54\]

\hypertarget{binary-number-system}{%
\subsection{Binary Number System}\label{binary-number-system}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The binary number system is a number system of base or radix equal to 2.
\item
  In the binary number system, there are two symbols to represent number: 0 and 1
\item
  When the symbols 0 an 1 are used to represent binary number, each symbol is called a binary digit or a bit.
\item
  Therefore, the binary number 1011 is a four-digit number or a 4-bit binary number.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{binary-to-decimal-conversion}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Multiply binary digit (1 or 0) in each position by the weight of the position and add the results.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{decimal-to-binary-conversion}{%
\subsubsection{Decimal-to-Binary Conversion}\label{decimal-to-binary-conversion}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To convert decimal numbers to their binary equivalent, the following procedures are employed:
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{whole-number-conversion-repeated-division-by-2}{%
\paragraph{Whole number conversion: Repeated division by 2}\label{whole-number-conversion-repeated-division-by-2}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The remainder resulting from each division forms binary number.
\item
  The first remainder to be produced is called the least significant bit (LSB) and the last remainder is called most significant bit (MSB).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 1: Convert the decimal number 17 to binary}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/NSbox5-1} \end{center}

\hypertarget{fractional-number-conversion-repeated-multiplication-by-2}{%
\paragraph{Fractional number conversion: Repeated multiplication by 2}\label{fractional-number-conversion-repeated-multiplication-by-2}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Multiply any factional part repeatedly by 2.
\item
  The equivalent binary number is formed from the 1 or 0 in the units position (\(10^0\) position).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 1: Convert the decimal number 0.625 to binary}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/NSbox6-1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sometimes it will be necessary to terminate the multiplication when an acceptable degree of accuracy is obtained. Then the resulted binary number will be an approximation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 2: Convert the decimal number 0.6375 to binary}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/NSbox7-1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We see that it continues in this way and does not terminate.
\item
  So, \(0.6375_{10} = (0.1010001101....)_{2}\).
\item
  If we discard all the bits after the 7th bit, then we get the approximate representation \(0.6375_{10} \approx (0.1010001)_{2},\) committing an error amounting to
  \[0.6375_{10} -(0.1010001)_{2}= 0.6375_{10} -0.6328125_{10}= (.0046875)_{10},\]
  which is known as \textbf{\emph{round-off error}}.
\item
  Although, strictly, this is \emph{chopping-off error}, it is generally, termed as \emph{round-off error}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \textbf{Sequence} can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order:
  \[a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, ..., a_{n}, ...\]
\item
  The number \(a_{1}\) is called the \emph{first term}, \(a_{2}\) is the \emph{second term}, and in general \(a_{n}\) is called the \(n^{th}\) \emph{term}.
\item
  We will deal exclusively with infinite sequences and so each term \(a_{n}\) will have a successor \(a_{n+1}\)
\item
  Notice that for every positive integer \(n\) there is a corresponding number \(a_{n}\) and so a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers.
\item
  But we usually write \(a_{n}\) instead of the function notation \(f(n)\) for the value of the function at the number \(n\).
\item
  \textbf{Notation:} The sequence \(\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},...\}\) is also denoted by
  \[\{a_{n}\}\] or \[\{a_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\]
\item
  Some sequences can be defined by giving a formula for the \(n\)th term.
\item
  In the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequences:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    by using the preceding notation
  \item
    by using the defining formula
  \item
    by writing out the terms of the sequence
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Notice that \(n\) doesn't have to start at 1.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  \(\{\frac{n}{n+1}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = \frac{n}{n+1}\hspace{5em}\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5},..., \frac{n}{n+1},... \}\)
\item
  \(\{\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = \frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\hspace{5em}\{-\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{9}, -\frac{4}{27}, \frac{5}{81},..., \frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}},... \}\)
\item
  \(\{\sqrt{n-3}\}_{n=3}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = \sqrt{n-3}, n\geq3\hspace{5em}\{0,1,\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3},..., \sqrt{n-3},...\}\)
\item
  \(\{cos\frac{n\pi}{6}\}_{n=0}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = cos\frac{n\pi}{6}, n\geq 0 \hspace{5em}\{1, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{1}{2}, 0,...,cos\frac{n\pi}{6},...\}\)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example}

Find a formula for the general term \(a_{n}\) of the sequence
\[\{\frac{3}{5},-\frac{4}{25}, \frac{5}{125}, -\frac{6}{625}, \frac{7}{3125},...\}\]
assuming that the pattern of the first few terms continues.

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ``unsinkable'' RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew

\textbf{Frequency Table (Frequency Distributions)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A frequency table (frequency distribution) is a listing of the values a variable takes in a data set, along with how often (frequently) each value occurs
\item
  frequency can be recorded as a

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{frequency or count:} the number of times a value occurs, or
  \item
    \textbf{percentage frequency:} the percentage of times a value occurs
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Percentage frequency can be calculated as,
\end{itemize}

\[Percentage frequency = \frac{a}{b} \times100 \%\]

\begin{itemize}

    to organize the data in a meaningful manner
  \item
    to determine the nature or shape of the distribution
  \item
    to draw charts and graphs for the presentation of data
  \item
    to facilitate computational procedures for measures of average and spread
  \item
    to make comparisons between different data sets
  \end{itemize}
\item
  There are two basic types of frequency tables

\hypertarget{grouped-frequency-distribution}{%
\subsubsection{Grouped frequency distribution}\label{grouped-frequency-distribution}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A grouped frequency distribution (table) is obtained by constructing classes (or intervals) for the data and then listing the corresponding number of values in each interval.
\item
  Suitable for quantitative variables with large number of possible values in the range of data.
\item
  Note that when items have been grouped in this way, their individual values are lost.
\item
  When studying about frequency distributions it is very important to know the meaning of the following terms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{i Class intervals}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In a frequency distribution the total range of the observations are divided into a number of classes. Those are called \emph{class intervals}
\item
  Eg: Class intervals: 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, \ldots{}, 40-44
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ii Class limits}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Class limits are the smallest and largest piece of data value that can fall into a given class.
\item
  In the class interval 10-14, the end numbers, 10 and 14, are called class limits
\item
  The smaller number (10) is the \emph{lower class limit}
\item
  The larger number (14) is the \emph{upper class limit}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{iii Class boundaries}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Class boundaries are obtained by adding the upper limit of one class interval to the lower limit of the next-higher class interval and dividing by 2.
\item
  Class boundaries are also called \textbf{True class limits}
\item
  Class boundaries \textbf{should not} \emph{coincide with actual observations}
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Class interval & Class boundaries\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
10 - 14 & 9.5 -- 14.5\tabularnewline
15 - 19 & 14.5 -- 19.5\tabularnewline
20 - 24 & 19.5 -- 24.5\tabularnewline
25 - 29 & 24.5 -- 29.5\tabularnewline
30 - 34 & 29.5 -- 34.5\tabularnewline
35 - 39 & 34.5 -- 39.5\tabularnewline
40 - 44 & 39.5 -- 44.5\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{iv The size or width of a class interval}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The size or width of a class interval is the difference between the \emph{lower and upper class boundaries}
\item
  It is also referred to as the \emph{class width, class size, or class length}
\item
  Eg: The class width for the class 10-14 is = 14.5-9.5 = 5
\end{itemize}

\textbf{v The class mark ( Midpoint of the class)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Midpoint of the class
\item
  Also called as \emph{class midpoint}
\item
  \(\text{Midpoint of the class} = \frac{\text{Lower limit} + \text{Upper limit}}{2}\)
\end{itemize}

or

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\text{Midpoint of the class} = \frac{\text{Lower boundary} + \text{Upper boundary}}{2}\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{vi Open class intervals}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A class interval that, at least theoretically, has either no upper class limit or no lower class limit indicated is called an \emph{open class interval}
\item
  For example, referring to age groups of individuals, the class interval ``65 year and over'' is an open class interval
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rules and Practices for constructing grouped frequency tables}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every data value should be in an interval
\item
  The intervals should be mutually exclusive
\item
  The classes of the distribution must be arrayed in size order.
\item
  The number of classes not less than 5 or not greater than 15 is recommended.
\item
  The following formula is often used to determine the number of classes:
  If n is the number of observations, then
\end{itemize}

\[\text{Number of classes} = \sqrt{n}\]

\[\text{Width of the class interval} = \frac{Range}{\sqrt{n}}= \frac{Min-Max}{\sqrt{n}}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data should be represented within classes having limits which the data can attain
\item
  Classes should be continuous
\item
  By convention, the beginning of the interval is given the appropriate exact value, rather than the end.\\
  Eg: intervals of 0-49, 50-99,100-149 would be preferred over the intervals 1-50, 51-100, 101-150 etc.
\item
  The number f observations falling into each category or class interval (class frequency) can be easily found using \emph{tally marks}.
\end{itemize}

Examples:

In a grouped frequency distribution, class intervals can be constructed in different ways

\textbf{II Histogram}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Histogram looks similar to bar chart since it also has bars.
\item
  However, it is different from a bar chart in a number of aspects.
\item
  One main difference is that in the histogram, the bars are drawn attached to each other; there are no gaps between bars like in a bar chart.
\item
  Histogram is used to show the shape of the distribution of a \textbf{continuous variable}.
\item
  However, the histogram is also used for discrete variables when the data are grouped in to class intervals.
\item
  In a histogram, \textbf{the area of a bar should be proportional to the frequency of the corresponding class.}
\item
  If all the bars have the same width, then the height of a bar can represent the frequency.
\item
  The bar corresponding to a class interval should be drawn from the lower class boundary to the upper class boundary. In this way there will be no gaps between the bars.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the mid-point of the top of each block in a histogram is joined by a straight line, a frequency polygon is produced.
\item

frequency curves arising in practice take on certain characteristics shapes as shown bellow

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/shapes} \end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{symmetrical} or \textbf{bell shaped} frequency curves are characterized by the fact that observations equidistant from the central maximum have the same frequency. An important example is the normal curve.
\item
  In the \textbf{moderately asymmetrical} or \textbf{skewed} frequency curves the tail of the curve to one side of the central maximum is longer than that to the other. If the longer tail occurs to the right the curve is said to be \textbf{skewed to the right} or to have \textbf{positive skewness}.While if the reverse is true the curve is said to be \textbf{skewed to the left} or to have \textbf{negative skewness}.
\item
  In a \textbf{J shaped} or \textbf{reverse J shaped} curve a maximum occurs at one end.
\item
  A \textbf{U shaped} frequency curve has maxima at both ends.
\item
  A \textbf{bimodal} frequency curve has two maxima. These appear as two distinct peaks (local maxima) in the frequency curve.When the two modes are unequal the larger mode is known as the major mode and the other as the minor mode.
\item
  A \textbf{multimodal} frequency curve has more than two maxima.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{V Dot Plot}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A dot plot is a method of presenting data which gives a rough but rapid visual appreciation of the way in which the data are distributed
\item
  It consists of a horizontal line marked out with divisions of the scale on which the variable is being measured
  -This graph can be used to represent only the numerical data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figure/dotplot-1} \end{center}

\textbf{VI Box plot (Box and whisker plot)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Box plot is also a useful method of representing the behavior of a data set or comparing two or more data sets.
\item
  Box plot is constructed by identifying five statistics from the data set as largest value, smallest values, median, Q1 and Q3.
\end{itemize}

\item
  A violin plot is a method of plotting quantitative data.
\item
  It is similar to a box plot, with the addition of a rotated kernel density plot on each side.
\item
  Violin plots are similar to box plots, except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values, usually smoothed by a kernel density estimator.

\section{Summary Measures}\label{summary-measures}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Although frequency distribution serves useful purpose, there are many situations that require other types of data summarization.
\item
  What we need in many instances is the ability to summarize the data by means of a single number called a descriptive measure.
\item
  Descriptive measures may be computed from the data of a sample or the data of a population. To distinguish between them we have the following definitions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A descriptive measure computed from the data of a sample is called a \textbf{statistic}.
\item
  A descriptive measure computed from the data of a population is called a \textbf{parameter}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{measures-of-central-tendency}{%
\subsection{Measures of Central Tendency}\label{measures-of-central-tendency}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Measure of central tendency} yield information about the center, or middle part, of a group of numbers.
\item
  Eg: Mode, Median, Arithmetic Mean, Geometric mean, Harmonic Mean, Quadratic Mean, Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mode}{%
\subsubsection{Mode}\label{mode}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The Mode is the most frequently occuring value in a set of data
\item
  Organizing the data into an ordered array (an ordering of the numbers from smallest to largest) helps to locate the mode.
\item
  A series having only one mode is called as \textbf{uni-modal}
\item
  In the case of a tie for the most frequent occuring value, two modes are listed. Then the data are set to be \textbf{bimodal}
\item
  If a set of data is not exactly bimodal but contains two values that are more dominant than others, some researchers take the liberty of referring to the data set as bimodal even without an \emph{exact tie} for the mode.
\item
  Data sets with more than two modes are referred to as \textbf{multimodal}.
\item
  The mode is an appropriate measure of central tendency for nominal-level data.
\item
  The mode can be used to determine which category occurs most frequently.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For ungrouped data}

\textbf{Example 01:} Find mode of the following datasets

Dataset 1: 12, 14, 10, 8, 6, 8, 15, 8

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/mode1-1} \end{center}

Dataset 2: 40, 44, 57, 48, 78

Dataset 3: 42, 45, 55, 50, 45, 40, 55, 45, 52, 55, 54

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/mode3-1} \end{center}

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{median}{%
\subsubsection{Median}\label{median}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The median is the middle value in an ordered array of numbers.
\item
  Median divides the series into equal parts
\item
  The following steps are used to determine the median.
\item
  STEP 1: Arrange the observations in an ordered data array.
\item
  STEP 2: For an \textbf{odd number} of terms, find the middle term of the ordered array. It is the median.
\item
  STEP 3: For an \textbf{even number} of terms, find the arithmetic mean of the middle two terms. This arithmetic mean is the median.
\end{itemize}

\[Median = \text{the }(\frac{n+1}{2})\text{th item in the data array} \]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The level of data measurement must be at least ordinal for a median to be meaningful.
\end{itemize}

\item
  Population Mean

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The poupulation mean us represented by the Greek letter \(mu\) (\(\mu\)).
  \item
    Let, \(N\) is the number of terms in the population.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\[\mu = \frac{\sum{x}}{N}=\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_N}{N}\]

    \[\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n}=\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_n}{n}\]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It is inappropriate to use the mean to analyse data that are not at least interval level in measurement.

\textbf{Empirical relationship between mean, mode, median}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In case of symmetrical distribution, mean, median and mode coincide \((mean = meadian= mode)\)
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box24 -1} \end{center}

\textbf{Choice between mean and median}

\begin{itemize}

\hypertarget{measures-of-variability}{%
\subsection{Measures of Variability}\label{measures-of-variability}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Measure of central tendency yield information about particular points of a data set.
\item
  However, business researchers can use another group of analytic tools to describe a set of data.
\item
  These tools are measures of variability, which describe the spread or the dispersion of a set of data.
\item
  Using measures of variability in conjunction with measures of central tendency makes possible a more complete numerical description of the data.
\item
  This section focuses on seven measures of variability for ungrouped data: range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, z score and coefficient of variation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{range}{%
\subsubsection{Range}\label{range}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The range is the difference between the largest value of a data set and the smallest value.
\end{itemize}

\[Range = Maximum - Minimum\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  One important use of the range is in quality assurance, where the range is used to construct control charts
\item
  Advantages and disadvantages of range
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Easy to understand and calculate
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider only the highest and lowest values of the data and fails to take account of any other observations in the dataset
\item
  Heavily influenced by extreme values
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{interquartile-range-iqr}{%
\subsubsection{Interquartile Range (IQR)}\label{interquartile-range-iqr}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We use the interquartile range (IQR) to measure the spread of a data around the median (M).
\item
  The interquartile range is the range of values between the first and third quartile.
\item
  Essentially it is the range of the middle 50\% of the data and is determined by computing the value of \(Q_3 - Q_1\).
\item
  The interquartile range is especially useful in situations where data users are more interested in values towards the middle and less interested in extremes.
\item
  The interquartile range is used in the construction of box and whisker plots.
\item
  By eliminating the lowest 25\% and the highest 25\% of the items in a series, we are left with the central 50\% , which are ordinarily free of extreme values.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Easy to understand and calculate
\item
  Not influenced by extreme values
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ignore the first \(25\%\) and the last \(25\%\) in the dataset
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{variance-and-standard-deviation}{%
\subsubsection{Variance and Standard Deviation}\label{variance-and-standard-deviation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To measure the spread of data around the mean, we use the standard deviation (S).
\item
  The variance and standard deviation are two very popular measures of dispersion.
\item
  These measures are not meaningful unless the data are at least interval-level data.
\item
  Their formulations are categorized into whether to evaluate from a population or from a sample.
\end{itemize}

\emph{NOTE}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sum of deviations from the arithmetic mean is always zero.
  \[{\sum{(x-\mu)} = 0}\]
\item
  This property requires considering the alternative ways to obtain measure of variability.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{variance}{%
\paragraph{Variance}\label{variance}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{variance} is the average of the squared deviations about the mean for a set of numbers.
\item
  The population variance is denoted by \(\sigma^2\)
\end{itemize}

\[\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The sum of the squared deviations about the mean of a set of values} - called the \textbf{sum of squares of} \(x\) and sometimes abbreviated as \(SS_x\)
\item
  Because the variance is computed from squared deviations, the final result is expressed in terms of squared units of measurements.
\item
  Statistics measured in squared units are problematic to interpret.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{standard-deviation}{%
\paragraph{Standard Deviation}\label{standard-deviation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
\item
  The population standard deviation is denoted by \(\sigma\)
\end{itemize}

\[\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}}=\sqrt{\sigma^2}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One feature of standard deviation that distinguishes it from a variance is that the standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the raw data, whereas the variance is expressed in those units squared.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Based on all the observations
\item
  Since this is based on arithmetic mean, it has all the merits of it
\item
  The most important and widely used measure of dispersion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Not easy to understand and difficult to calculate
\item
  Gives more weight to extreme values, because the values are squared up
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{empirical-rule}{%
\subsubsection{Empirical Rule}\label{empirical-rule}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The empirical rule is an important rule of thumb that is used to state the approximate percentage of values that lie within a given number of standard deviations from the mean of a set of data \textbf{if the data are normally distributed}
\item
  The empirical rule is used only for three numbers of standard deviations: \(1\sigma\), \(2\sigma\), \(3\sigma\)
\end{itemize}

\end{longtable}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/emp -1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If a set of data is normally distributed, or bell shaped, approximately \(68\%\) of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean, \(95\%\) are within two standard deviations, and almost \(100\%\) are within three standard deviations.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{population-versus-sample-variance-and-standard-deviations}{%
\subsubsection{Population versus sample variance and standard deviations}\label{population-versus-sample-variance-and-standard-deviations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The sample variance is denoted by \(s^2\) and the sample standard deviation by \(s\).
\item
  The main use for sample variances and standard deviations is as estimators of population variances and standard deviations.
\item
  Thus, computation of the sample variance and standard deviation differs slightly from computation of the population variance and standard deviation.
\item
  Both the sample variance and sample standard deviation use \(n-1\)int he denominator instead of \(n\) because using \(n\) in the denominator of a sample variance results in a statistic that tends to underestimate the population variance.
\item
  While discussion of the properties of \emph{good estimator} is beyond the scope of this course, one of the properties of a good estimator is being \emph{unbiased}.
\item
  Whereas, using \(n\) in the denominator of the sample variance makes it a \emph{biased} estimator, using \(n-1\) allows it to be an \emph{unbiased} estimator, which is a desirable property in inferential statistics.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sample variance}

\[s^2 = \frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}\]

\textbf{Sample standard deviation}

\[s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}= \sqrt{s^2}\]

\hypertarget{computational-formulas-for-variance-and-standard-deviation}{%
\subsubsection{Computational formulas for variance and standard deviation}\label{computational-formulas-for-variance-and-standard-deviation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An alternative method of computing variance and standard deviation, sometimes referred to as the computational method or shortcut method, is available.
\item
  Algebraically,
\end{itemize}

\[\sum{(x-\mu)^2}= \sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{N}\]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/variance1-1} \end{center}

and

\[\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}= \sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}\]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/variance2-1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Substituting these equivalent expressions into the original formulas for variance and standard deviation yields the following computational formulas.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Computational formula for population variance and standard deviation}

\[\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{N}}{N}\]

\[\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}\]

\textbf{Computational formula for sample variance and standard deviation}

\[s^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}}{n-1}\]

\[s = \sqrt{s^2}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For situations in which the mean is already computed or is given, alternative forms of these formulas are:
\end{itemize}

\[\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}-N\mu^2}{N}\]

\[s^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}-n(\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\]

\hypertarget{coefficient-of-variation}{%
\subsubsection{Coefficient of variation}\label{coefficient-of-variation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In general, for two variables measured with he same units (eg: two groups of people both weighed in kg), the group with the larger variance and standard deviation has n=more variability among their scores.
\item
  The unit of measure affects the size od the variance.
\item
  The same population weights, expressed in `grams' rather than kg would have a larger variance and standard deviation.
\item
  The \emph{coefficient of variation}, a measure of relative variability gets around this difficulty and makes it possible to compare variability across variables measured in different units.
\item
  The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage and is denoted CV.
\end{itemize}

\[CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}(100)\]

\textbf{Using median and quartile deviation}

\[CV = \frac{\frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}}{Median}(100)\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The coefficient of variation essentially is a relative comparison of a standard deviation to its mean.
\item
  The coefficient of variation can be useful in comparing standard deviations that have been computed from data with different means.
\item
  The choice of whether to use a coefficient of variation or raw standard deviations to compare multiple standard deviations is a matter of preference
\item
  The coefficient of variation also provides and optional method of interpreting the value of a standard deviation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{measures-of-shape}{%
\subsection{Measures of Shape}\label{measures-of-shape}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Measures of shape are tools that can be used to describe the shape of a distribution of data.
\item
  In this section, we examine two measures of shapes: skewness and Kurtosis.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{skewness}{%
\subsubsection{Skewness}\label{skewness}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A distribution of data in which the right half is a mirror image of the left half is said to be \emph{symmetrical.}
\item
  One example of a symmetrical distribution is the normal distribution, or bell curve.
\item
  \textbf{Skewness} is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry
\item
  The measures of asymmetry are called as measures of skewness.
\item
  The skewed portion is the long, thin part of the curve
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Skewness and the relationship of the mean, median and mode}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The concept of skewness helps us to understand the relationship between the mean, median and mode.
\item
  In a unimodal distribution (distribution with a single peak or mode) that is skewed, the mode is the apex (high point) of the curve and the median is the middle value.
\item
  The mean tends to be located toward the tail of the distribution, because the mean is affected by all values, including the extreme ones.
\item
  A bell-shaped or normal distribution with the mean, median and mode all at the centre of the distribution has no skewness.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{pearsonian-coefficient-of-skewness}{%
\paragraph{Pearsonian coefficient of skewness}\label{pearsonian-coefficient-of-skewness}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This coefficient compares the mean and median in light of the magnitude of the standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\[S_k = \frac{3(\mu-M_d)}{\sigma}\]

where \(S_k\) = coefficient of skewness, \(M_d\) = median

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Note that if the distribution is symmetrical, the mean and median are the same value and hence the coefficient of skewness is equal to zero.
\item
  If the value of \(S_k\) is positive, the distribution is positively skewed.
\item
  If the value of \(S_k\) is negative, the distribution is negatively skewed.
\item
  The greater the magnitude of \(S_k\), the more skewed is the distribution.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{kurtosis}{%
\subsubsection{Kurtosis}\label{kurtosis}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Kurtosis describes the amount of peakedness of a distribution.
\item
  \textbf{Kurtosis} is a measure of whether the data are peaked or flat relative to a normal distribution
\item
  Distributions that are high and thin are referred to as \textbf{leptokurtic} distributions.
\item
  Distributions that are flat and spread out are referred to as \textbf{platykurtic} distributions.
\item
  Between the above two types are distributions that are more `normal' in shape, referred to as \textbf{mesokurtic} distributions
\end{itemize}

  Many times in business it is important to explore the relationship between two numerical variables
\item
  Measures of association are statistics that yeild information about the relatedness of numerical variables.
\item
  In this section, we discuss only one measure of association, correlation, and d so only for two numerical variables.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{scatter-plot}{%
\subsubsection{Scatter plot}\label{scatter-plot}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A scatter plot is a two dimensional graph of pairs of points from \textbf{two numerical} variables
\item
  In a quantitative bi-variate dataset, we have a \((x,y)\) pair for each sampling unit, where \(x\) denotes the independent variable and \(y\) denotes the dependent variable.
\item
  Each \((x,y)\) pair can be considered as a point on the Cartesian plan.
\item
  Scatter plot is a plot of all the \((x,y)\) pairs in the dataset.
\item
  The purpose of scatter plot is to illustrate any relationship between two quantitative variables.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the variables are related, what kind of relationship it is, linear or nonlinear?
  \item
    If the relationship is linear, the scatter plot will show whether it is negative or positive.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} \emph{Edgar Anderson's Iris Data}

This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

\hypertarget{correlation}{%
\subsubsection{Correlation}\label{correlation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Correlation is a measure of the degree of relatedness of two or more variables.
\item
  Several measures of correlation are available , the selection of which depends mostly on the level of data being analysed.
\item
  Ideally, researchers would like to calculate \(\rho\), the \textbf{population} coefficient of correlation.
\item
  However, because researchers virtually always deal with sample data, this section introduces a widely used sample coefficient of correlation, \(r\).
\item
  This measure is applicable \textbf{only if both variables being analysed have at least an interval level of data}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient} (\(r\))

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The statistic \(r\) is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, named after Karl Pearson (1857 - 1936).
\item
  The tern \(r\) is a measure of the \textbf{linear} correlation of two variables.
\item
  It is a number that ranges from -1 to 0 to +1, representing th strength of the linear relationship between the variables.
\item
  An \(r\) value of \(+1\) denotes a perfect \textbf{linear} positive relationship between two variables.
\item
  An \(r\) value of \(-1\) denotes a perfect \textbf{linear} negative relationship between two variables, which indicates an inverse relationship between two variables: as one variable gets larger, the other gets smaller.
\item
  An \(r\) value of 0 means no \textbf{linear} relationship is present between the two variables.
\end{itemize}

\[ r = \frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2\sum(y-\bar{y})^2}}\]

\[ r = \frac{\sum{xy} - \frac{(\sum x\sum y)}{n}}{\sqrt{[\sum{x^2- \frac{(\sum{x})^2}{n}}][\sum y^2-\frac{(\sum y)^2}{n}]}}\]

\textbf{NOTE}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When \(r=0\), it signifies there is \textbf{no linear} relationship between the two variables. (There can be a non-linear relationship, Figure (e))
\item
  Figure (e): There is a very strong curvilinear relationship. But there is \textbf{no linear} relationship.

  A power company in Sri Lanka designs and manufactures power distribution switchboards for hospitals, bridges, airports, highways and water treatment plants. Power company marketing director wants to determine client satisfaction with their products and services. He developed a questionnaire that yields a satisfaction score between 0 and 100 for participant responses. A random sample of 50 of the company's 1000 clients is asked to complete a satisfaction survey. The satisfaction scores for the 50 participants are averaged to produce a mean satisfaction score.

  Everyday we hear, or make statements to convey ideas about possibilities of occurring events.

  \item
    What are \textbf{odds} of our cricket team winning the next world cup?
  \item
    What is the \textbf{chance} of getting an A+ for CM1110?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In order to make decisions or take actions, we need to \textbf{quantify the possibility} of occurrence of an event. For this, we use the term \textbf{probability}.
\item
  Probability is a \textbf{quantitative measure} of uncertainty, a \textbf{number} that conveys the strength of our belief in the occurrence of an uncertain event.
\item
  The likelihood of an outcome is quantified by assigning a number from the interval {[}0, 1{]} to the outcome (or a percentage from 0 to 100\%).
\item
  Higher numbers indicate that the outcome is more likely than lower numbers.
\item
  A probability of 0 indicates an outcome will not occur.
\item
  A probability of 1 indicates that an outcome will occur with certainty.

\subsection{Random Experiments}\label{random-experiments}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statisticians use the word \textbf{experiment} to describe any process that generates a set of data.
\item
  An experiment usually involves observing or counting or measuring. For example;

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    we might classify items coming off an assembly line as defective or non-defective
  \item
    we may record the number of accidents that occur monthly at the Katubedda junction, hoping to justify the installation of a traffic light;
  \item
    or we may be interested in the volume of gas released in a chemical reaction when the concentration of an acid is varied.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  An experiment that is repeatable in an identical fashion is called a \textbf{random experiment} or a \textbf{probability experiment}.
\item
  Random experiment is an activity that leads to the occurrence of one of several possible outcomes which is not likely to be known until its completion, that is, the outcome is not perfectly predictable. This process has the properties that,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All possible outcomes can be specified in advance.
  \item
    It can be repeated in an \textbf{identical manner.}
  \item
    The same outcome may not occur on various repetitions so that the actual outcome is not known in advance.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Examples}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tossing a coin.
\item
  Throwing a die (or several dice)
\item
  Drawing cards from a pack
\item
  Launching of missile and observing its velocity at specified times.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{outcomes}{%
\subsection{Outcomes}\label{outcomes}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The result of a \textbf{single experiment} is called an outcome.
\item
  It can be instrument reading, counts, ``yes'' or ``no'' answers, values obtained through extensive calculations etc.
\item
  To model and analyze a random experiment, we must understand the set of possible outcomes from the experiment.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sample-space}{%
\subsection{Sample space}\label{sample-space}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the \textbf{sample space} of the experiment.
\item
  We denote the sample space by \(\Omega\).
\item
  Each outcome in a sample space is called an \textbf{element} of the sample space or simply a \textbf{sample point}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 01}
\emph{Write down the corresponding sample space of the following experiments?}

\textbf{Example 01:} A player rolls a die.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box71a-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Example 02:} A player rolls two dice.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box71b-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Example 03:} A quality control engineer of a certain company takes a random sample of 4 products as the products come off its production line and counts the number of defective products in the sample.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box71c-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Example 04:} A quality control engineer of a certain company takes a random sample of 4 products as products come off its production line and determines whether each product is defective or non-defective

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box71d-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Example 05:} A company produces a certain type of car batteries. If a battery has a voltage that is outside certain limits, that battery is characterized as bad (B); if the battery has a voltage within the prescribed limits it is characterized as good (G). A quality inspector selects batteries one by one as they come off the production line and tests them until he gets a bad battery. He uses this data to estimate the proportion of bad batteries produced by the company.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box71e-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Example 06:} An experiment consists of measuring the lifetime of a bulb.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box71f-1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A sample space is often defined based on the objectives of the analysis.
\item
  The following example illustrates several alternatives
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}

Consider an experiment that selects a digital camera and records the recycle time of a flash (the time taken to ready the camera for another flash). The possible values for recycle time can vary according to the resolution of the timer and on the minimum and maximum recycle times.

However, since the time is positive we can define the sample space as simply the positive real line

\textbf{\emph{Case I}}

\textbf{\emph{Case II}} If it is known that all recycle times are between 1.0 and 5.5 seconds, the sample space can be written as

\textbf{\emph{Case III}} If the objective of the analysis is to consider only whether the recycle time is low, medium or high, the sample space can be written as a set of three outcomes

\textbf{\emph{Case IV}} If the objective is only to evaluate whether or not a particular camera confirms to a minimum recycle time specification, the sample space can be written as a set of two outcomes

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The number of outcomes in the sample space can be \textbf{finite} or \textbf{infinite}.
\item
  Infinite sample spaces can be \textbf{countable} or \textbf{uncountable}.
\item
  A sample space is countable if the outcomes can be associated with the integers \(1, 2,3,\dots\).
\item
  If the sample space contains a finite number of elements or an infinite though countable number of elements, it is said to be \textbf{discrete}.
\item
  The outcomes of some experiments are neither finite nor countably infinite, it is said to be \textbf{continuous}.\\
\item
  In the above Example, the choice \(\Omega = \{x | x \geq 0\}\) is an example of a continuous sample space,
\item
  \(\Omega = \{yes, no\}\) is a discrete sample space.
\item
  As mentioned, the best choice of a sample space depends on the objectives of the study.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{An event is a subset of the sample space of a random experiment}
\item
  Events are usually denoted by capital English letters A, B, C, D, E etc.
\item
  An event containing only one outcome is called a \textbf{simple event}.
\item
  An event containing more than one outcome is called a \textbf{compound event}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 02}
\emph{Express the following events as subsets of the sample spaces. Decide whether each event is simple or compound. (No need to calculate probabilities yet.)}

\subsubsection{Sum Rule Principle}\label{sum-rule-principle}}

\textbf{Example 1:} Suppose there are 8 male professors (say A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H) and 5 female professors (say J, K, L, M, N) teaching a language class. How many ways are there, a student can choose a language professor?

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box81-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Example 2:} Suppose there are 3 different mystery novels, 5 different romance novels, and 4 different adventure novels on a bookshelf. How many different ways are there to choose one of the novels?

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box82-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Sum Rule Principle:} Suppose an event \(E_1\) can occur in \(n_1\) ways, a second event \(E_2\) can occur in \(n_2\) ways, a third event \(E_3\) can occur in \(n_3\) ways and so on, and suppose no two of the events can occur simultaneously (at the same time). Then one of the events can occur in \(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + \dots\) ways

\emph{This principle can be stated in terms of sets as follows,}

\textbf{Sum Rule Principle:} Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive events (disjoint events). Then: \[n(A \cup B)   = n(A) + n(B)\]

\subsubsection{Product Rule Principle / Multiplication Rule}\label{product-rule-principle-multiplication-rule}}

\textbf{Example 3:} The design for a Website is to consist of four colors, three fonts, and three positions for an image. Draw a tree diagram for the different types of designs.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box83-1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  How many different designs are possible?
\item
  The above tree diagram describes the sample space of all possible designs.
\item
  The size of the sample space equals the number of branches in the last level of the tree, and this quantity equals \(4 \times 3 \times 3 = 36\). - This leads to the following useful result.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Product Rule Principle / Multiplication Rule:} Assume an operation can be described as a sequence of k steps, and
- the number of ways of completing step 1 is \(n_1\), and
- the number of ways of completing step 2 is \(n_2\) for each way of completing step 1, and
- the number of ways of completing step 3 is \(n_3\) for each way of completing step 2, and so forth.
The total number of ways of completing the operation is \(n_1\times n_2 \times \dots \times n_k\)

\textbf{NOTE}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This result follows from the multiplication rule. - A permutation can be constructed by selecting the element to be placed in the first position of the sequence from the n elements, then selecting the element for the second position from the remaining \((n-1)\) elements, then selecting the element for the third position from the remaining \((n-2)\) elements, and so forth.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Here the element is replaced in the set before the next element is chosen.
\item
  Since there are \(n\) different ways to choose each element (repetitions are allowed), the product rule principle tells us that there are
  \[n.n.n\dots n = n^r\]
  different ordered possibilities of size \(r\).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 12:} How many ``three digit numbers'' can be made with the four digits 3, 5, 7 and 8 (A digit can be used as much as you can)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Here the element is not replaced in the set before the next element is chosen.
\item
  Thus, there are no repetitions in the ordered sample.
\item
  Accordingly, an ordered sample of size \$r4 without replacement is simply an \(r\) permutation of the elements in the set with \(n\) elements.
\item
  In other words, by the product rule, the first element can be chosen in \(n\) ways, the second in \((n-1)\) ways, and so on
  \[n.(n-1)(n-2)\dots (n-r+1) = \frac{n.(n-1)(n-2)\dots (n-r+1).(n-r)!}{(n-r)!} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} = ^nP_r\]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{NOTE}

Consider the case that \(n = r\). we get

\[^nP_r=\frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \frac{n!}{0!} = \frac{n!}{1}=n!\]

\textbf{Example 13:} How many ``three digit numbers'' can be made with the four digits 3, 5, 7 and 8 (without repetition)

\textbf{Example 14:} A printed circuit board has eight different locations in which a component can be placed. If four different components are to be placed on the board, how many different designs are possible?

\hypertarget{combinations}{%
\subsection{Combinations}\label{combinations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Another counting problem of interest is the number of subsets of \(r\) elements that can be selected from a set of \(n\) elements.
\item
  These are called \textbf{combinations}.
\item
  Here, \textbf{order is not important}.
\item
  For example, the combinations of the letters a, b, c, d taken three at a time are \(\{a,b,c\}, \{a,b,d\}, \{a,c,d\}, \{b,c,d\}\) or simply \(abc, abd, acd, bcd\)
\item
  Observe that the following combinations are equal:
  \[abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba\]
\item
  That is, each denotes the same set \(\{a, b, c\}\).
\item
  The number of combinations of \(n\) objects taken \(r\) at a time will be denoted by \(^nC_r\).
\end{itemize}

Before we derive the general formula for \(^nC_r\) , we consider a particular case.

\textbf{Example:} Find the number of combinations of four objects a, b, c, d taken three at a time.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Combinations & Permutations\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\(\{a,b,c\}\) &\tabularnewline
\(\{a,b,d\}\) &\tabularnewline
\(\{a,c,d\}\) &\tabularnewline
\(\{b,c,d\}\) &\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As can be seen in the above table, each combination consisting of three objects determines \(3! = 6\) permutations of the objects in the combination.
\item
  Thus, the number of combinations multiplied by \(3!\) equals the number of permutations.
\item
  That is,
  \[^4C_3\times 3! = ^4P_3\]
  \[^4C_3 = \frac{^4P_3}{3!}\]
  But we know \(^4p_3 = \frac{4!}{(4-3)!}=\frac{4!}{1!} = 2.3.4 = 24\) and \(3!=6\).
\end{itemize}

Thus
\[^4C_3 = \frac{24}{6} = 4\]
which is noted in the above table.

\textbf{Formula for} \(^nC_r\)

Since any combination of \(n\) objects taken \(r\) at a time determines \(r!\) permutations of the objects in the combination, we can conclude that
\[^nC_r\times r! = ^nP_r.\]

Thus we obtain the following formula for \(^nC_r\) as

\[^nC_r\times = \frac{^nP_r}{r!} = \frac{\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.\]

\textbf{Example 15:} In a small company there are 8 executive managers. How many ways are there to select 3 executive managers to form a new committee?

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/box891-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Sum Rule Principle:}

Suppose an event \(E_1\) can occur in \(n_1\) ways, a second event \(E_2\) can occur in \(n_2\) ways, a third event \(E_3\) can occur in \(n_3\) ways and so on, and suppose no two of the events can occur simultaneously (at the same time ).
Then one of the events can occur in \(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + \dots\) ways

\textbf{Product Rule Principle / Multiplication Rule}

Assume an operation can be described as a sequence of \(k\) steps, and
- the number of ways of completing step 1 is \(n_1\), and
- the number of ways of completing step 2 is \(n_2\) for each way of completing step 1, and
- the number of ways of completing step 3 is \(n_3\) for each way of completing step 2, and so forth.

The total number of ways of completing the operation is \(n_1 \times n_2 \times \dots \times n_k\)

\textbf{Permutations}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/Permutations} \end{center}

\[n!\quad\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad  \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_k!}\quad\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad n^r\quad \quad \quad \quad  \quad \quad ^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\]

\textbf{Number of combinations of \(n\) objects taken} \(r\) \textbf{at a time} \(( r \leq n)\)

\[^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\]
