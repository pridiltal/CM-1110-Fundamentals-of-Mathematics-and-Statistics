\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every number in number system taken as a complex number
\item
  A number of the form \(a+ib\) is called a complex number when \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers and \(i=\sqrt{-1}\).
\item
  We call `\(a\)' the real part and `\(b\)' the imaginary part of the complex number \(a+ib\).
\item
  IF \(a=0\) the number \(ib\) is said to be purely imaginary, if \(b=0\) the number \(a\) is real.
\item
  A pair of complex number \(a+ib\) and \(a-ib\) are said to be conjugate of each other.
\item
  Show that the sum and product of a complex number and its conjugate complex are both real.
\end{itemize}

Let \(x+iy\) be a complex number and \(x-iy\) its conjugate complex.

\[Sum = (x+iy)+(x-iy) = 2x\]\\
\[Product = (x+iy).(x-iy) = x^{2}+y^{2}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let \(a+ib\) and \(c+id\) be two complex numbers. Then
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Addition.} \((a+ib) + (c+id)= (a+c)+i(b+d)\)

\textbf{Subtraction} \((a+ib) - (c+id)= (a-c)+i(b-d)\)

\textbf{Multiplication} \((a+ib) \times (c+id)= ac-bd+i(ad+bc)\)

\textbf{Addition.} \(\frac{a+ib}{c+id}= \frac{a+ib}{c+id}.\frac{c-id}{c-id}= \frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}+i\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{imaginary-numbers}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A number does not exist in the number line is called imaginary number.
\item
  For example square root of negative numbers are imaginary numbers. It is denoted by \(i\).
  i.e \[\sqrt{-1}=i\] \newline
  \[i^{2} = â€“ 1\]
\item
  So there is no real number \(i\) that satisfies the above equation.
\item
  The quantity \(i\) is called the unit imaginary number.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Geometrical Representation of imaginary numbers}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figure/1-ImgNum} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let OA be positive numbers which is represented by \(x\) and \(OA^\prime\) by \(-x\)
\item
  And \(-x= (i)^2x=i(ix)\) is on \(OX^{\prime}\)
\item
  It means that the multiplication of the real number \(x\) by \(i\) twice amounts to the rotation of OA through two right angles to reach \(OA^\prime\).
\item
  Thus, it means that multiplication of \(x\) by \(i\) is equivalent to the rotation of \(x\) through one right angle to reach \(OA^{\prime\prime}\).
\item
  Hence, y-axis is known as imaginary axis.
\item
  Multiplication by \(i\) rotates its direction through right angle.

  Examples

  \(19/6 = 3.16666666.....\)

  \(18/7 = 2.57142857142857.......\)

  \(21/9= 2.3333.......\)

\section{Number representations}\label{number-representations}}

Decimal: The standard Hindu--Arabic numeral system using base ten.

Binary: The base-two numeral system used by computers.

Hexadecimal: Widely used by computer system designers and programmers, as they provide a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values.

Octal: Occasionally used by computer system designers and programmers.

Duodecimal: The most convenient numeral system, due to twelve's divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.

Sexagesimal: Originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians

(See positional notation for information on other bases)

Roman numerals: The numeral system of ancient Rome, still occasionally used today.

Tally marks: usually used for counting things that increase by small amounts and don't change very quickly.

Fractions: A representation of a non-integer as a ratio of two integers. These include improper fractions as well as mixed numbers.

Continued fraction: An expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on.

Scientific notation: A method for writing very small and very large numbers using powers of 10. When used in science, such a number also conveys the precision of measurement using significant figures.

Knuth's up-arrow notation, Conway chained arrow notation, and Bowers's operators : Notations that allow the concise representation of some extremely large integers such as Graham's number.

\section{Sequences}\label{sequences}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \textbf{Sequence} can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order:
  \[a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, ..., a_{n}, ...\]
\item
  The number \(a_{1}\) is called the \emph{first term}, \(a_{2}\) is the \emph{second term}, and in general \(a_{n}\) is called the \(n^{th}\) \emph{term}.
\item
  We will deal exclusively with infinite sequences and so each term \(a_{n}\) will have a successor \(a_{n+1}\)
\item
  Notice that for every positive integer \(n\) there is a corresponding number \(a_{n}\) and so a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers.
\item
  But we usually write \(a_{n}\) instead of the function notation \(f(n)\) for the value of the function at the number \(n\).
\item
  \textbf{Notation:} The sequence \(\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},...\}\) is also denoted by
  \[\{a_{n}\}\] or \[\{a_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\]
\item
  Some sequences can be defined by giving a formula for the \(n\)th term.
\item
  In the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequences:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    by using the preceding notation
  \item
    by using the defining formula
  \item
    by writing out the terms of the sequence
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Notice that \(n\) doesn't have to start at 1.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  \(\{\frac{n}{n+1}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = \frac{n}{n+1}\hspace{5em}\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5},..., \frac{n}{n+1},... \}\)
\item
  \(\{\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = \frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\hspace{5em}\{-\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{9}, -\frac{4}{27}, \frac{5}{81},..., \frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}},... \}\)
\item
  \(\{\sqrt{n-3}\}_{n=3}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = \sqrt{n-3}, n\geq3\hspace{5em}\{0,1,\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3},..., \sqrt{n-3},...\}\)
\item
  \(\{cos\frac{n\pi}{6}\}_{n=0}^{\infty} \hspace{5em} a_{n} = cos\frac{n\pi}{6}, n\geq 0 \hspace{5em}\{1, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{1}{2}, 0,...,cos\frac{n\pi}{6},...\}\)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example}

Find a formula for the general term \(a_{n}\) of the sequence
\[\{\frac{3}{5},-\frac{4}{25}, \frac{5}{125}, -\frac{6}{625}, \frac{7}{3125},...\}\]
assuming that the pattern of the first few terms continues.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are four levels of measurements called, \textbf{nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.}
\item
  Each levels has its own rules and restrictions
\item
  Different levels of measurement contains different amount of information with respect to whatever the data are measuring
\end{itemize}

\textbf{i Nominal Scale}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Qualitative
\item
  No order or ranking in categories.
\item
  These categories have to be mutually exclusive, i.e.~it should not be possible to place an individual or object in more than one category
\item
  A name of a category can be substituted by a number, but it will be mere label and have no numerical meaning
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ii Ordinal Scale}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Qualitative
\item
  Categories can be ordered or ranked
\item
  A name of a category can be substituted by a number, but such a sequence does not indicate absolute quantities.
\item
  Difference between any two numbers on the scale does not have a numerical meaningful.
\item
  It cannot be assumed that the differences between adjacent numbers on the scale are equal.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{iii Interval Scale}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Quantitative
\item
  Data can be ordered or ranked
\item
  There is no absolute zero point. Zero is only an arbitrary point with which other values can compare
\item
  Difference between two numbers is a meaningful numerical value
\item
  Ration of two numbers is not a meaningful numerical value.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{iv Ratio Scale}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Quantitative
\item
  Highest level of measurement
\item
  There exist an absolute zero point (It has a true zero point)
\item
  Ratio between different measurements is meaningful

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ``unsinkable'' RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew

\hypertarget{grouped-frequency-distribution}{%
\subsubsection{Grouped frequency distribution}\label{grouped-frequency-distribution}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A grouped frequency distribution (table) is obtained by constructing classes (or intervals) for the data and then listing the corresponding number of values in each interval.
\item
  Suitable for quantitative variables with large number of possible values in the range of data.
\item
  Note that when items have been grouped in this way, their individual values are lost.
\item
  When studying about frequency distributions it is very important to know the meaning of the following terms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{i Class intervals}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In a frequency distribution the total range of the observations are divided into a number of classes. Those are called \emph{class intervals}
\item
  Eg: Class intervals: 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, \ldots{}, 40-44
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ii Class limits}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Class limits are the smallest and largest piece of data value that can fall into a given class.
\item
  In the class interval 10-14, the end numbers, 10 and 14, are called class limits
\item
  The smaller number (10) is the \emph{lower class limit}
\item
  The larger number (14) is the \emph{upper class limit}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{iii Class boundaries}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Class boundaries are obtained by adding the upper limit of one class interval to the lower limit of the next-higher class interval and dividing by 2.
\item
  Class boundaries are also called \textbf{True class limits}
\item
  Class boundaries \textbf{should not} \emph{coincide with actual observations}
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Class interval & Class boundaries\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
10 - 14 & 9.5 -- 14.5\tabularnewline
15 - 19 & 14.5 -- 19.5\tabularnewline
20 - 24 & 19.5 -- 24.5\tabularnewline
25 - 29 & 24.5 -- 29.5\tabularnewline
30 - 34 & 29.5 -- 34.5\tabularnewline
35 - 39 & 34.5 -- 39.5\tabularnewline
40 - 44 & 39.5 -- 44.5\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{iv The size or width of a class interval}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The size or width of a class interval is the difference between the \emph{lower and upper class boundaries}
\item
  It is also referred to as the \emph{class width, class size, or class length}
\item
  Eg: The class width for the class 10-14 is = 14.5-9.5 = 5
\end{itemize}

\textbf{v The class mark ( Midpoint of the class)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Midpoint of the class
\item
  Also called as \emph{class midpoint}
\item
  \(\text{Midpoint of the class} = \frac{\text{Lower limit} + \text{Upper limit}}{2}\)
\end{itemize}

or

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\text{Midpoint of the class} = \frac{\text{Lower boundary} + \text{Upper boundary}}{2}\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{vi Open class intervals}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A class interval that, at least theoretically, has either no upper class limit or no lower class limit indicated is called an \emph{open class interval}
\item
  For example, referring to age groups of individuals, the class interval ``65 year and over'' is an open class interval
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rules and Practices for constructing grouped frequency tables}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every data value should be in an interval
\item
  The intervals should be mutually exclusive
\item
  The classes of the distribution must be arrayed in size order.
\item
  The number of classes not less than 5 or not greater than 15 is recommended.
\item
  The following formula is often used to determine the number of classes:
  If n is the number of observations, then
\end{itemize}

\[\text{Number of classes} = \sqrt{n}\]

\[\text{Width of the class interval} = \frac{Range}{\sqrt{n}}= \frac{Min-Max}{\sqrt{n}}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data should be represented within classes having limits which the data can attain
\item
  Classes should be continuous
\item
  By convention, the beginning of the interval is given the appropriate exact value, rather than the end.\\
  Eg: intervals of 0-49, 50-99,100-149 would be preferred over the intervals 1-50, 51-100, 101-150 etc.
\item
  The number f observations falling into each category or class interval (class frequency) can be easily found using \emph{tally marks}.
\end{itemize}

Examples:

In a grouped frequency distribution, class intervals can be constructed in different ways

Example 1

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Class interval & Number of students\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
10 - 14 & 4\tabularnewline

\end{itemize}

\textbf{II Histogram}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Histogram looks similar to bar chart since it also has bars.
\item
  However, it is different from a bar chart in a number of aspects.
\item
  One main difference is that in the histogram, the bars are drawn attached to each other; there are no gaps between bars like in a bar chart.
\item
  Histogram is used to show the shape of the distribution of a \textbf{continuous variable}.
\item
  However, the histogram is also used for discrete variables when the data are grouped in to class intervals.
\item
  In a histogram, \textbf{the area of a bar should be proportional to the frequency of the corresponding class.}
\item
  If all the bars have the same width, then the height of a bar can represent the frequency.
\item
  The bar corresponding to a class interval should be drawn from the lower class boundary to the upper class boundary. In this way there will be no gaps between the bars.
\end{itemize}

Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a histogram for the data

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Marks & Number of students\tabularnewline

\textbf{III Frequency polygon}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the mid-point of the top of each block in a histogram is joined by a straight line, a frequency polygon is produced.
\item
  This is done under the assumption that the frequencies in a class-interval are evenly distributed throughout the class
\end{itemize}

Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a frequency polygon for the data

frequency curves arising in practice take on certain characteristics shapes as shown bellow

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/shapes} \end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{symmetrical} or \textbf{bell shaped} frequency curves are characterized by the fact that observations equidistant from the central maximum have the same frequency. An important example is the normal curve.
\item
  In the \textbf{moderately asymmetrical} or \textbf{skewed} frequency curves the tail of the curve to one side of the central maximum is longer than that to the other. If the longer tail occurs to the right the curve is said to be \textbf{skewed to the right} or to have \textbf{positive skewness}.While if the reverse is true the curve is said to be \textbf{skewed to the left} or to have \textbf{negative skewness}.
\item
  In a \textbf{J shaped} or \textbf{reverse J shaped} curve a maximum occurs at one end.
\item
  A \textbf{U shaped} frequency curve has maxima at both ends.
\item
  A \textbf{bimodal} frequency curve has two maxima. These appear as two distinct peaks (local maxima) in the frequency curve.When the two modes are unequal the larger mode is known as the major mode and the other as the minor mode.
\item
  A \textbf{multimodal} frequency curve has more than two maxima.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{V Dot Plot}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A dot plot is a method of presenting data which gives a rough but rapid visual appreciation of the way in which the data are distributed
\item
  It consists of a horizontal line marked out with divisions of the scale on which the variable is being measured
  -This graph can be used to represent only the numerical data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figure/dotplot-1} \end{center}

\textbf{VI Box plot (Box and whisker plot)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Box plot is also a useful method of representing the behavior of a data set or comparing two or more data sets.
\item
  Box plot is constructed by identifying five statistics from the data set as largest value, smallest values, median, Q1 and Q3.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/boxplot} \end{center}

Example:

Construct a box plot for the following data set (Marks of students)

\[\text{52, 88, 56, 79, 72, 91,  85, 88, 68, 63, 76, 73, 86, 95, 12, 69}\]

Xmin = 12 Xmax = 95 Q1 =64.25 Q2 = Median = 74.5 Q3 = 87.5

\textbf{VII Violin plot}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A violin plot is a method of plotting quantitative data.
\item
  It is similar to a box plot, with the addition of a rotated kernel density plot on each side.
\item
  Violin plots are similar to box plots, except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values, usually smoothed by a kernel density estimator.

\section{Summary Measures}\label{summary-measures}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Although frequency distribution serves useful purpose, there are many situations that require other types of data summarization.
\item
  What we need in many instances is the ability to summarize the data by means of a single number called a descriptive measure.
\item
  Descriptive measures may be computed from the data of a sample or the data of a population. To distinguish between them we have the following definitions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A descriptive measure computed from the data of a sample is called a \textbf{statistic}.
\item
  A descriptive measure computed from the data of a population is called a \textbf{parameter}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Measure of central tendency} yield information about the center, or middle part, of a group of numbers.
\item
  Eg: Mode, Median, Arithmetic Mean, Geometric mean, Harmonic Mean, Quadratic Mean, Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mode}{%
\subsubsection{Mode}\label{mode}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The Mode is the most frequently occuring value in a set of data
\item
  Organizing the data into an ordered array (an ordering of the numbers from smallest to largest) helps to locate the mode.
\item
  A series having only one mode is called as \textbf{uni-modal}
\item
  In the case of a tie for the most frequent occuring value, two modes are listed. Then the data are set to be \textbf{bimodal}
\item
  If a set of data is not exactly bimodal but contains two values that are more dominant than others, some researchers take the liberty of referring to the data set as bimodal even without an \emph{exact tie} for the mode.
\item
  Data sets with more than two modes are referred to as \textbf{multimodal}.
\item
  The mode is an appropriate measure of central tendency for nominal-level data.
\item
  The mode can be used to determine which category occurs most frequently.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For ungrouped data}

\textbf{Example 01:} Find mode of the following datasets

Dataset 1: 12, 14, 10, 8, 6, 8, 15, 8

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{median}{%
\subsubsection{Median}\label{median}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The median is the middle value in an ordered array of numbers.
\item
  Median divides the series into equal parts
\item
  The following steps are used to determine the median.
\item
  STEP 1: Arrange the observations in an ordered data array.
\item
  STEP 2: For an \textbf{odd number} of terms, find the middle term of the ordered array. It is the median.
\item
  STEP 3: For an \textbf{even number} of terms, find the arithmetic mean of the middle two terms. This arithmetic mean is the median.
\end{itemize}

\[Median = \text{the }(\frac{n+1}{2})\text{th item in the data array} \]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The level of data measurement must be at least ordinal for a median to be meaningful.

  \item
    Let, \(N\) is the number of terms in the population.

\subsection{Measures of Variability}\label{measures-of-variability}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Measure of central tendency yield information about particular points of a data set.
\item
  However, business researchers can use another group of analytic tools to describe a set of data.
\item
  These tools are measures of variability, which describe the spread or the dispersion of a set of data.
\item
  Using measures of variability in conjunction with measures of central tendency makes possible a more complete numerical description of the data.
\item
  This section focuses on seven measures of variability for ungrouped data: range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, z score and coefficient of variation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{range}{%
\subsubsection{Range}\label{range}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The range is the difference between the largest value of a data set and the smallest value.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  One important use of the range is in quality assurance, where the range is used to construct control charts
\item
  Advantages and disadvantages of range
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Easy to understand and calculate
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\item
  Heavily influenced by extreme values
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{interquartile-range-iqr}{%
\subsubsection{Interquartile Range (IQR)}\label{interquartile-range-iqr}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We use the interquartile range (IQR) to measure the spread of a data around the median (M).
\item
  The interquartile range is the range of values between the first and third quartile.
\item
  Essentially it is the range of the middle 50\% of the data and is determined by computing the value of \(Q_3 - Q_1\).
\item
  The interquartile range is especially useful in situations where data users are more interested in values towards the middle and less interested in extremes.
\item
  The interquartile range is used in the construction of box and whisker plots.
\item
  By eliminating the lowest 25\% and the highest 25\% of the items in a series, we are left with the central 50\% , which are ordinarily free of extreme values.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Easy to understand and calculate
\item
  Not influenced by extreme values
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}

  Ignore the first \(25\%\) and the last \(25\%\) in the dataset
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{variance-and-standard-deviation}{%
\subsubsection{Variance and Standard Deviation}\label{variance-and-standard-deviation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To measure the spread of data around the mean, we use the standard deviation (S).
\item
  The variance and standard deviation are two very popular measures of dispersion.
\item
  These measures are not meaningful unless the data are at least interval-level data.
\item
  Their formulations are categorized into whether to evaluate from a population or from a sample.
\end{itemize}

\emph{NOTE}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sum of deviations from the arithmetic mean is always zero.
  \[{\sum{(x-\mu)} = 0}\]
\item
  This property requires considering the alternative ways to obtain measure of variability.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{variance}{%
\paragraph{Variance}\label{variance}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{variance} is the average of the squared deviations about the mean for a set of numbers.
\item
  The population variance is denoted by \(\sigma^2\)
\end{itemize}

\[\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The sum of the squared deviations about the mean of a set of values} - called the \textbf{sum of squares of} \(x\) and sometimes abbreviated as \(SS_x\)
\item
  Because the variance is computed from squared deviations, the final result is expressed in terms of squared units of measurements.
\item
  Statistics measured in squared units are problematic to interpret.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{standard-deviation}{%
\paragraph{Standard Deviation}\label{standard-deviation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
\item
  The population standard deviation is denoted by \(\sigma\)
\end{itemize}

\[\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}}=\sqrt{\sigma^2}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One feature of standard deviation that distinguishes it from a variance is that the standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the raw data, whereas the variance is expressed in those units squared.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Based on all the observations
\item
  Since this is based on arithmetic mean, it has all the merits of it
\item
  The most important and widely used measure of dispersion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Not easy to understand and difficult to calculate
\item
  Gives more weight to extreme values, because the values are squared up
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{empirical-rule}{%
\subsubsection{Empirical Rule}\label{empirical-rule}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The empirical rule is an important rule of thumb that is used to state the approximate percentage of values that lie within a given number of standard deviations from the mean of a set of data \textbf{if the data are normally distributed}
\item
  The empirical rule is used only for three numbers of standard deviations: \(1\sigma\), \(2\sigma\), \(3\sigma\)
\end{itemize}

  If a set of data is normally distributed, or bell shaped, approximately \(68\%\) of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean, \(95\%\) are within two standard deviations, and almost \(100\%\) are within three standard deviations.

\subsubsection{Population versus sample variance and standard deviations}\label{population-versus-sample-variance-and-standard-deviations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The sample variance is denoted by \(s^2\) and the sample standard deviation by \(s\).
\item
  The main use for sample variances and standard deviations is as estimators of population variances and standard deviations.
\item
  Thus, computation of the sample variance and standard deviation differs slightly from computation of the population variance and standard deviation.
\item
  Both the sample variance and sample standard deviation use \(n-1\)int he denominator instead of \(n\) because using \(n\) in the denominator of a sample variance results in a statistic that tends to underestimate the population variance.
\item
  While discussion of the properties of \emph{good estimator} is beyond the scope of this course, one of the properties of a good estimator is being \emph{unbiased}.
\item
  Whereas, using \(n\) in the denominator of the sample variance makes it a \emph{biased} estimator, using \(n-1\) allows it to be an \emph{unbiased} estimator, which is a desirable property in inferential statistics.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sample variance}

\[s^2 = \frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}\]

\textbf{Sample standard deviation}

\[s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}= \sqrt{s^2}\]

\hypertarget{computational-formulas-for-variance-and-standard-deviation}{%
\subsubsection{Computational formulas for variance and standard deviation}\label{computational-formulas-for-variance-and-standard-deviation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An alternative method of computing variance and standard deviation, sometimes referred to as the computational method or shortcut method, is available.
\item
  Algebraically,
\end{itemize}

\[\sum{(x-\mu)^2}= \sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{N}\]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/variance1-1} \end{center}

and

\[\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}= \sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}\]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/variance2-1} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Substituting these equivalent expressions into the original formulas for variance and standard deviation yields the following computational formulas.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Computational formula for population variance and standard deviation}

\[\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{N}}{N}\]

\[\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}\]

\textbf{Computational formula for sample variance and standard deviation}

\[s^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}- \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}}{n-1}\]

\[s = \sqrt{s^2}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For situations in which the mean is already computed or is given, alternative forms of these formulas are:
\end{itemize}

\[\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}-N\mu^2}{N}\]

\[s^2 = \frac{\sum{x^2}-n(\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\]

\hypertarget{coefficient-of-variation}{%
\subsubsection{Coefficient of variation}\label{coefficient-of-variation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In general, for two variables measured with he same units (eg: two groups of people both weighed in kg), the group with the larger variance and standard deviation has n=more variability among their scores.
\item
  The unit of measure affects the size od the variance.
\item
  The same population weights, expressed in `grams' rather than kg would have a larger variance and standard deviation.
\item
  The \emph{coefficient of variation}, a measure of relative variability gets around this difficulty and makes it possible to compare variability across variables measured in different units.
\item
  The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage and is denoted CV.
\end{itemize}

\[CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}(100)\]

\textbf{Using median and quartile deviation}

\[CV = \frac{\frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}}{Median}(100)\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The coefficient of variation essentially is a relative comparison of a standard deviation to its mean.
\item
  The coefficient of variation can be useful in comparing standard deviations that have been computed from data with different means.
\item
  The choice of whether to use a coefficient of variation or raw standard deviations to compare multiple standard deviations is a matter of preference
\item
  The coefficient of variation also provides and optional method of interpreting the value of a standard deviation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{measures-of-shape}{%
\subsection{Measures of Shape}\label{measures-of-shape}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Measures of shape are tools that can be used to describe the shape of a distribution of data.
\item
  In this section, we examine two measures of shapes: skewness and Kurtosis.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{skewness}{%
\subsubsection{Skewness}\label{skewness}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A distribution of data in which the right half is a mirror image of the left half is said to be \emph{symmetrical.}
\item
  One example of a symmetrical distribution is the normal distribution, or bell curve.
\item
  \textbf{Skewness} is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry
\item
  The measures of asymmetry are called as measures of skewness.
\item
  The skewed portion is the long, thin part of the curve
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Skewness and the relationship of the mean, median and mode}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The concept of skewness helps us to understand the relationship between the mean, median and mode.
\item
  In a unimodal distribution (distribution with a single peak or mode) that is skewed, the mode is the apex (high point) of the curve and the median is the middle value.
\item
  The mean tends to be located toward the tail of the distribution, because the mean is affected by all values, including the extreme ones.
\item
  A bell-shaped or normal distribution with the mean, median and mode all at the centre of the distribution has no skewness.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{pearsonian-coefficient-of-skewness}{%
\paragraph{Pearsonian coefficient of skewness}\label{pearsonian-coefficient-of-skewness}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This coefficient compares the mean and median in light of the magnitude of the standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\[S_k = \frac{3(\mu-M_d)}{\sigma}\]

where \(S_k\) = coefficient of skewness, \(M_d\) = median

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Note that if the distribution is symmetrical, the mean and median are the same value and hence the coefficient of skewness is equal to zero.
\item
  If the value of \(S_k\) is positive, the distribution is positively skewed.
\item
  If the value of \(S_k\) is negative, the distribution is negatively skewed.
\item
  The greater the magnitude of \(S_k\), the more skewed is the distribution.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{kurtosis}{%
\subsubsection{Kurtosis}\label{kurtosis}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Kurtosis describes the amount of peakedness of a distribution.
\item
  \textbf{Kurtosis} is a measure of whether the data are peaked or flat relative to a normal distribution
\item
  Distributions that are high and thin are referred to as \textbf{leptokurtic} distributions.
\item
  Distributions that are flat and spread out are referred to as \textbf{platykurtic} distributions.
\item
  Between the above two types are distributions that are more `normal' in shape, referred to as \textbf{mesokurtic} distributions
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{measures-of-association}{%
\subsection{Measures of Association}\label{measures-of-association}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Many times in business it is important to explore the relationship between two numerical variables
\item
  Measures of association are statistics that yeild information about the relatedness of numerical variables.
\item
  In this section, we discuss only one measure of association, correlation, and d so only for two numerical variables.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{scatter-plot}{%
\subsubsection{Scatter plot}\label{scatter-plot}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A scatter plot is a two dimensional graph of pairs of points from \textbf{two numerical} variables
\item
  In a quantitative bi-variate dataset, we have a \((x,y)\) pair for each sampling unit, where \(x\) denotes the independent variable and \(y\) denotes the dependent variable.
\item
  Each \((x,y)\) pair can be considered as a point on the Cartesian plan.
\item
  Scatter plot is a plot of all the \((x,y)\) pairs in the dataset.
\item
  The purpose of scatter plot is to illustrate any relationship between two quantitative variables.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the variables are related, what kind of relationship it is, linear or nonlinear?
  \item
    If the relationship is linear, the scatter plot will show whether it is negative or positive.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} \emph{Edgar Anderson's Iris Data}

This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figure/scatterplot-1} \end{center}

\hypertarget{correlation}{%
\subsubsection{Correlation}\label{correlation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Correlation is a measure of the degree of relatedness of two or more variables.
\item
  Several measures of correlation are available , the selection of which depends mostly on the level of data being analysed.
\item
  Ideally, researchers would like to calculate \(\rho\), the \textbf{population} coefficient of correlation.
\item
  However, because researchers virtually always deal with sample data, this section introduces a widely used sample coefficient of correlation, \(r\).
\item
  This measure is applicable \textbf{only if both variables being analysed have at least an interval level of data}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient} (\(r\))

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The statistic \(r\) is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, named after Karl Pearson (1857 - 1936).
\item
  The tern \(r\) is a measure of the \textbf{linear} correlation of two variables.
\item
  It is a number that ranges from -1 to 0 to +1, representing th strength of the linear relationship between the variables.
\item
  An \(r\) value of \(+1\) denotes a perfect \textbf{linear} positive relationship between two variables.
\item
  An \(r\) value of \(-1\) denotes a perfect \textbf{linear} negative relationship between two variables, which indicates an inverse relationship between two variables: as one variable gets larger, the other gets smaller.
\item
  An \(r\) value of 0 means no \textbf{linear} relationship is present between the two variables.
\end{itemize}

\[ r = \frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2\sum(y-\bar{y})^2}}\]

\[ r = \frac{\sum{xy} - \frac{(\sum x\sum y)}{n}}{\sqrt{[\sum{x^2- \frac{(\sum{x})^2}{n}}][\sum y^2-\frac{(\sum y)^2}{n}]}}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Examples: Following figure shows five different degrees of correlation:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/cor-1} \end{center}

\textbf{NOTE}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When \(r=0\), it signifies there is \textbf{no linear} relationship between the two variables. (There can be a non-linear relationship, Figure (e))
\item
  Figure (e): There is a very strong curvilinear relationship. But there is \textbf{no linear} relationship.
\end{itemize}
