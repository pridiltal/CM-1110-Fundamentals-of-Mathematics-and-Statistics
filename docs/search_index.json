We call ‘\\(a\\)’ the real part and ‘\\(b\\)’ the imaginary part of the complex number \\(a+ib\\). If \\(a=0\\) the number \\(ib\\) is said to be purely imaginary, if \\(b=0\\) the number \\(a\\) is real. A pair of complex number \\(a+ib\\) and \\(a-ib\\) are said to be conjugate of each other. Show that the sum and product of a complex number and its conjugate complex are both real. Let \\(x+iy\\) be a complex number and \\(x-iy\\) its conjugate complex. \\[Sum = (x+iy)+(x-iy) = 2x\\] \\[Product = (x+iy).(x-iy) = x^{2}+y^{2}\\] Let \\(a+ib\\) and \\(c+id\\) be two complex numbers. Then Addition. \\((a+ib) + (c+id)= (a+c)+i(b+d)\\) Subtraction \\((a+ib) - (c+id)= (a-c)+i(b-d)\\) Multiplication \\((a+ib) \\times (c+id)= ac-bd+i(ad+bc)\\) Addition. \\(\\frac{a+ib}{c+id}= \\frac{a+ib}{c+id}.\\frac{c-id}{c-id}= \\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}+i\\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}\\) Complex numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) 1.1.2 Imaginary numbers A number does not exist in the number line is called imaginary number. For example square root of negative numbers are imaginary numbers. It is denoted by \\(i\\). i.e \\[\\sqrt{-1}=i\\] \\[i^{2} = – 1\\] So there is no real number \\(i\\) that satisfies the above equation. The quantity \\(i\\) is called the unit imaginary number. Geometrical Representation of imaginary numbers Let OA be positive numbers which is represented by \\(x\\) and \\(OA^\\prime\\) by \\(-x\\) And \\(-x= (i)^2x=i(ix)\\) is on \\(OX^{\\prime}\\) It means that the multiplication of the real number \\(x\\) by \\(i\\) twice amounts to the rotation of OA through two right angles to reach \\(OA^\\prime\\). Thus, it means that multiplication of \\(x\\) by \\(i\\) is equivalent to the rotation of \\(x\\) through one right angle to reach \\(OA^{\\prime\\prime}\\). Hence, y-axis is known as imaginary axis. Multiplication by \\(i\\) rotates its direction through right angle. 1.1.3 Real numbers All numbers that can be represented on the number line are called real numbers. The real numbers is the set of numbers containing all of the rational numbers and all of the irrational numbers. The real numbers are “all the numbers” on the number line. Real Numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). 1.1.4 Rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) A rational number is defined as number of the form \\(x/y\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers and \\(y \\neq 0\\). i.e Any number which can be expressed as in the form of \\(p/q\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the integers and \\(q \\neq 0\\). The set of rational numbers encloses the set of integers and fractions. The rational numbers that are not integral will have decimal values. These values can be of two types Terminating decimal fractions (finite decimal factors): For example \\(1/5 = 0.5\\) , \\(13/5 = 2.6\\). Non Terminating decimal fractions : The non terminating decimal fractions having two types. Non terminating periodic fractions Non terminating non periodic fractions i) Non terminating periodic fractions These are non terminating decimal fractions of the type \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmb1b2b3b4b5 .....bm\\) Examples \\(19/6 = 3.16666666.....\\) \\(18/7 = 2.57142857142857.......\\) \\(21/9= 2.3333.......\\) ii) Non terminating non periodic fractions These are non terminating and there is no periodic decimal places for that number. i.e \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmc1c2.........\\) for example 6.789542587436512………. So from above terminating and non terminating periodic fraction numbers belongs to rational numbers. 1.1.5 Irrational numbers Irrational numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) An Irrational numbers are non terminating and non periodic fractions. i.e irrational number is a number that cannot be written as a ratio \\(x/y\\) form (or fraction). In decimal form, it never ends or repeats. Examples for irrational numbers are \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213......\\), \\(\\pi = 3.14159265.......\\), \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) etc. 1.1.6 Integers All numbers that do not having the decimal places in them are called integers. All whole numbers including Negative number + Positive number \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{...,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,...\\}\\) i.e the integer it may positive or negative or zero. The set of integers generally written \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)for short. Any integers are added, subtracted, or multiplied the result is always is an integer. When any integers multiplied , each of the multiplied integer is called a factor or divisor of the resulting product 1.1.7 Whole numbers The set of whole numbers means narrator numbers and \\(0\\) Whole numbers = \\(\\mathbb{W} = \\{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...\\}\\) 1.1.8 Natural numbers The counting numbers start with 1 and their end is not defined. Generally it is denoted by “N” i.e \\(\\mathbb{N} =\\{1,2,3,4,...\\}\\) Reading : Dass, H. K. (2008). ‘Complex Numbers’, Advanced Engineering Mathematics. S. Chand Publishing. pp. 474-520. 1.2 Number representations 1.2.1 Glossary of terms used in the positional numeral systems There are various types of the number system in mathematics. The four most common number system types are: Decimal number system (Base- 10) Binary number system (Base- 2) Octal number system (Base-8) Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16) System Radix/ Base Digits Binary 2 0 1 Octal 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Decimal 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Hexadecimal 16 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 1.2.2 Decimal number system The Decimal number system is a number of base or radix equal to 10. To determine the actual number in each position , take the number that appears in the position and multiply it by \\(10^x\\), where \\(x\\) is the power representation. Example 1: The value of the combination of symbols 453 is determined by adding the weights of each position as \\[4\\times10^2+5\\times10^1+3\\times10^0\\] \\[= 4\\times100 + 5\\times10+3\\times1\\] Or \\[= 400+50+3 = 453\\] Example 2: The value of the combination of symbols 369.54 is determined by adding the weights of each position as \\[3\\times10^2+6\\times10^1+9\\times10^0+5\\times10^{-1}+4\\times10^{-2}\\] Or \\[= 300 + 60+9+\\frac{5}{10}+\\frac{4}{100}\\] Or \\[= 300 + 60+9+0.5+0.04= 369.54\\] 1.2.3 Binary number system The binary number system is a number system of base or radix equal to 2. In the binary number system there are two symbols to represent number: 0 and 1 When the symbols 0 an 1 are used to represent binary number, each symbol is called a binary digit or a bit. Therefore, the binary number 1011 is a four-digit number or a 4-bit binary number 1.2.3.1 Binary-to-Decimal Conversion Multiply binary digit (1 or 0) in each position by the weight of the position and add the results. Example 1: Convert the binary number 11010 to its decimal equivalent Example 2: Convert the binary number 0.011 to its decimal equivalent Example 3: Convert the binary number 110.011 to its decimal equivalent 1.2.3.2 Decimal-to-Binary Conversion To convert decimal numbers to their binary equivalent, the following procedures are employed: 1.2.3.2.1 Whole number conversion : Repeated division by 2 The remainder resulting from each division forms binary number. The first remainder to be produced is called the least significant bit (LSB) and the last remainder is called most significant bit (MSB) Example 1: Convert the decimal number 17 to binary 1.2.3.2.2 Fractional number conversion : Repeated multiplication by 2 Multiply repeatedly by 2 any factional part The equivalent binary number is formed from the 1 or 0 in the units position (\\(10^0\\) position). Example 1: Convert the decimal number 0.625 to binary Sometimes it will be necessary to terminate the multiplication when an acceptable degree of accuracy is obtained. Then the resulted binary number will be an approximation. Example 2: Convert the decimal number 0.6 to binary Example 3: Convert the decimal number 49.683 to binary 1.2.4 Octal number system The octal system is a number system of base or radix equal to 8. 1.2.4.1 Octal-to-decimal conversion Example 1: Convert the following octal numbers to their decimal equivalent \\(35_8\\) \\(100_8\\) \\(0.24_8\\) 1.2.4.2 Decimal-to-octal conversion To convert decimal numbers to their octal equivalent, the following procedures are employed: 1.2.4.2.1 Whole number conversion : Repeated division by 8 Example 1: Convert the decimal number 245 to octal equivalent 1.2.4.2.2 Fractional number conversion : Repeated multiplication by 8 Example 2: Convert the decimal fraction 0.432 to octal equivalent This conversion to octal is not precise as there is a remainder. If greater accuracy is required, continue multiplying by 8 to obtain more octal digits. Example 3: Convert the decimal number 419.95 to octal equivalent 1.2.4.3 Octal-to-binary conversion ** Octal and binary number correspondence** Octal Binary 0 000 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 To convert from octal to binary, simply replace each octal digit with the corresponding three-digit binary number. Example 1: Convert the following octal numbers to their binary equivalent \\(247_8\\) \\(124.375_8\\) 1.2.4.4 Binary-to-octal conversion To convert from binary to octal,the binary number is divided into groups of three bits and then each group of three bits is replaced by an octal digit. Example 1: Convert the binary number 11010101.01101 to its octal equivalent 1.2.5 Hexadecimal number system The Hexadecimal system is a number system of base or radix equal to 816. Hexadecimal is similar to the octal numeral system because each can be easily compared to the binary numeral system. Example values of hexadecimal numbers converted into binary, octal and decimal. Hexadecimal Binary Octal Decimal 0 0000 0 0 1 0001 1 1 2 0010 2 2 3 0011 3 3 4 0100 4 4 5 0101 5 5 6 0110 6 6 7 0111 7 7 8 1000 10 8 9 1001 11 9 A 1010 12 10 B 1011 13 11 C 1100 14 12 D 1101 15 13 E 1110 16 14 F 1111 17 15 1.2.5.1 Hexadecimal-to-decimal conversion Example 1: Convert the following octal numbers to their decimal equivalent \\(C7_{16}\\) \\(2F_{16}\\) 1.2.5.2 Decimal-to-Hexadecimal conversion To convert decimal numbers to their hexadecimal equivalent, the following procedures are employed: 1.2.5.2.1 Whole number conversion : Repeated division by 16 Example 1: Convert the decimal number 245 to Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.2.2 Fractional number conversion : Repeated multiplication by 16 Example 2: Convert the decimal fraction 0.0738 to Hexadecimal equivalent Example 3: Convert the decimal number 420.0095 to Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.3 Hexadecimal-to-binary conversion To convert from Hexadecimal to binary, simply replace each Hexadecimal digit with the corresponding four-digit binary number. Example 1: Convert the following Hexadecimal numbersto their binary equivalent \\(7B_{16}\\) \\(6D.8C_{16}\\) 1.2.5.4 Binary-to-Hexadecimal conversion To convert from binary to Hexadecimal, the binary number is divided into groups of four bits and then each group of four bits is replaced by an Hexadecimal digit. Example 1: Convert the binary number 11010101.01101 to its Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.5 Octal-to-Hexadecimal conversion First convert octal to binary, and then convert binary to hexadecimal. Example 1: Convert the octal number 365.52 to its Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.6 Hexadecimal-to-octal conversion First convert Hexadecimal to binary, and then convert binary to octal Example 1: Convert the octal number D2B.284 to its Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.6 Binary Arithmetic The arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of binary numbers follow the rules as summarized below Decimal: The standard Hindu–Arabic numeral system using base ten. Binary: The base-two numeral system used by computers. Hexadecimal: Widely used by computer system designers and programmers, as they provide a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Octal: Occasionally used by computer system designers and programmers. Duodecimal: The most convenient numeral system, due to twelve’s divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}. Sexagesimal: Originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians (See positional notation for information on other bases) Roman numerals: The numeral system of ancient Rome, still occasionally used today. Tally marks: usually used for counting things that increase by small amounts and don’t change very quickly. Fractions: A representation of a non-integer as a ratio of two integers. These include improper fractions as well as mixed numbers. Continued fraction: An expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on. Scientific notation: A method for writing very small and very large numbers using powers of 10. When used in science, such a number also conveys the precision of measurement using significant figures. Knuth’s up-arrow notation, Conway chained arrow notation, and Bowers’s operators : Notations that allow the concise representation of some extremely large integers such as Graham’s number. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers https://byjus.com/maths/number-system/ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320677641_Number_System http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/resources/BinaryNumbers.pdf https://www.cs.bu.edu/courses/cs101a1/slides/CS101.Lect15.BinaryNumbers.ppt.pdf 4 https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~ee314/handouts/numsys.pdf http://www.uobabylon.edu.iq/eprints/publication_3_8400_6187.pdf https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos217/lectures/03_NumberSystems.pdf Number system is used in IT applications Number Systems Rational, irrational numbers "]
