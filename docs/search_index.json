For example square root of negative numbers are imaginary numbers. It is denoted by \\(i\\). i.e \\[\\sqrt{-1}=i\\] \\[i^{2} = – 1\\] So there is no real number \\(i\\) that satisfies the above equation. The quantity \\(i\\) is called the unit imaginary number. 1.1.3 Real numbers All numbers that can be represented on the number line are called real numbers. The real numbers is the set of numbers containing all of the rational numbers and all of the irrational numbers. The real numbers are “all the numbers” on the number line. Real Numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). 1.1.4 Rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) A rational number is defined as number of the form \\(x/y\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers and \\(y \\neq 0\\). i.e Any number which can be expressed as in the form of \\(p/q\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the integers and \\(q \\neq 0\\). The set of rational numbers encloses the set of integers and fractions. The rational numbers that are not integral will have decimal values. These values can be of two types Terminating decimal fractions (finite decimal factors): For example \\(1/5 = 0.5\\) , \\(13/5 = 2.6\\). Non Terminating decimal fractions : The non terminating decimal fractions having two types. Non terminating periodic fractions Non terminating non periodic fractions i) Non terminating periodic fractions These are non terminating decimal fractions of the type \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmb1b2b3b4b5 .....bm\\) Examples \\(19/6 = 3.16666666.....\\) \\(18/7 = 2.57142857142857.......\\) \\(21/9= 2.3333.......\\) ii) Non terminating non periodic fractions These are non terminating and there is no periodic decimal places for that number. i.e \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmc1c2.........\\) for example 6.789542587436512………. So from above terminating and non terminating periodic fraction numbers belongs to rational numbers. 1.1.5 Irrational numbers \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) An Irrational numbers are non terminating and non periodic fractions. i.e irrational number is a number that cannot be written as a ratio \\(x/y\\) form (or fraction). In decimal form, is never ends or repeats. Examples for irrational numbers are \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213......\\), \\(\\pi = 3.14159265.......\\), \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) etc. 1.1.6 Integers All numbers that do not having the decimal places in them are called integers. All whole numbers including Negative number + Positive number \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{...,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,...\\}\\) i.e the integer it may positive or negative or zero. The set of integers generally written \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)for short. Any integers are added, subtracted, or multiplied the result is always is an integer. When any integers multiplied , each of the multiplied integer is called a factor or divisor of the resulting product 1.1.7 Whole numbers The set of whole numbers means narrator numbers and \\(0\\) Whole numbers = \\(\\mathbb{W} = \\{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...\\}\\) 1.1.8 Natural numbers The counting numbers start with 1 and their end is not defined. Generally it is denoted by “N” i.e \\(\\mathbb{N} =\\{1,2,3,4,...\\}\\) 1.2 Number representations Decimal: The standard Hindu–Arabic numeral system using base ten. Binary: The base-two numeral system used by computers. Hexadecimal: Widely used by computer system designers and programmers, as they provide a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Octal: Occasionally used by computer system designers and programmers. Duodecimal: The most convenient numeral system, due to twelve’s divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}. Sexagesimal: Originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians (See positional notation for information on other bases) Roman numerals: The numeral system of ancient Rome, still occasionally used today. Tally marks: usually used for counting things that increase by small amounts and don’t change very quickly. Fractions: A representation of a non-integer as a ratio of two integers. These include improper fractions as well as mixed numbers. Continued fraction: An expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on. Scientific notation: A method for writing very small and very large numbers using powers of 10. When used in science, such a number also conveys the precision of measurement using significant figures. Knuth’s up-arrow notation, Conway chained arrow notation, and Bowers’s operators : Notations that allow the concise representation of some extremely large integers such as Graham’s number. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers https://byjus.com/maths/number-system/ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320677641_Number_System http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/resources/BinaryNumbers.pdf https://www.cs.bu.edu/courses/cs101a1/slides/CS101.Lect15.BinaryNumbers.ppt.pdf https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~ee314/handouts/numsys.pdf http://www.uobabylon.edu.iq/eprints/publication_3_8400_6187.pdf https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos217/lectures/03_NumberSystems.pdf Number system is used in IT applications Number Systems Rational, irrational numbers "]
