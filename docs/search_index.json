Talagala 2020-03-25 Course Syllabus Pre-requisites CM 1110 Remark: This course module contains two main sections: (1) mathematics and (2) statistics. This syllabus is designed for the statistics section. Lectures for mathematics section and statistics section are conducted by two lecturers as two separate sub modules (1.5 hour lectures/Week). End Semester Examination is conducted as a single examination. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this module, students will be able to plan more carefully the design of experiment in advance which provide evidence for or against theories of cause and effect and make inferences about population characteristics based on sample information and thereby solve data analysis problems in different application domains.
