["number-systems.html", "Chapter 1 Number Systems 1.1 Main types 1.2 Number representations References", " Chapter 1 Number Systems Numbers can be classified according to how they are represented or according to the properties that they have. 1.1 Main types 1.1.1 Complex numbers Every number in number system is considered as a complex number A number of the form \\(a+ib\\) is called a complex number when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers and \\(i=\\sqrt{-1}\\). For a given complex number, \\(a+ib\\), ‘\\(a\\)’ is known as the real part and ‘\\(b\\)’ is known as the imaginary part. If \\(a=0\\), the number \\(ib\\) is said to be purely imaginary, if \\(b=0\\) the number \\(a\\) is real. A pair of complex number \\(a+ib\\) and \\(a-ib\\) are said to be conjugate of each other. Show that the sum and product of a complex number and its conjugate complex are both real. Let \\(a+ib\\) and \\(c+id\\) be two complex numbers. Then Addition. \\((a+ib) + (c+id)= (a+c)+i(b+d)\\) Subtraction \\((a+ib) - (c+id)= (a-c)+i(b-d)\\) Multiplication \\((a+ib) \\times (c+id)= ac-bd+i(ad+bc)\\) Addition. \\(\\frac{a+ib}{c+id}= \\frac{a+ib}{c+id}.\\frac{c-id}{c-id}= \\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}+i\\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}\\) Complex numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{C}\\). 1.1.2 Imaginary numbers A number that does not exist in the number line is known as imaginary number. For example, square root of negative numbers are imaginary numbers. It is denoted by \\(i\\). i.e \\[\\sqrt{-1}=i\\] \\[i^{2} = – 1\\] So there is no real number \\(i\\) that satisfies the above equation. The quantity, \\(i\\) is called the unit imaginary number. Geometrical Representation of imaginary numbers Let OA be positive numbers which is represented by \\(x\\) and \\(OA^\\prime\\) by \\(-x\\). And \\(-x= (i)^2x=i(ix)\\) is on \\(OX^{\\prime}\\). According to the above expression, the multiplication of the real number \\(x\\) by \\(i\\) twice amounts is equivalent to the rotation of OA through two right angles to reach \\(OA^\\prime\\). Therefore, the multiplication of \\(x\\) by \\(i\\) is equivalent to the rotation of \\(x\\) through one right angle to reach \\(OA^{\\prime\\prime}\\). Therefore, y-axis is known as imaginary axis. Multiplication by \\(i\\) rotates its direction through right angle. 1.1.3 Real numbers All numbers that can be represented on the number line are known as real numbers. The real numbers is the set of numbers containing all of the rational numbers and all of the irrational numbers. Real Numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). 1.1.4 Rational numbers Rational Numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) A rational number is defined as number of the form \\(x/y\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers and \\(y \\neq 0\\). The set of rational numbers encloses the set of integers and fractions. The rational numbers that are not integral will have decimal values. These values can be of two types Terminating decimal fractions (finite decimal factors): For example \\(1/5 = 0.5\\) , \\(13/5 = 2.6\\). Non Terminating decimal fractions. The non terminating decimal fractions having two types: Non terminating periodic fractions Non terminating non periodic fractions i) Non terminating periodic fractions These are non terminating decimal fractions of the type \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmb1b2b3b4b5 .....bm\\) Examples \\(19/6 = 3.16666666.....\\) \\(18/7 = 2.57142857142857.......\\) \\(21/9= 2.3333.......\\) ii) Non terminating non periodic fractions These are non terminating and there is no periodic decimal places for that number. i.e \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmc1c2.........\\) for example 6.789542587436512………. So from above terminating and non terminating periodic fraction numbers belongs to rational numbers. 1.1.5 Irrational numbers Irrational numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) Irrational numbers are consisted with non terminating and non periodic fractions. i.e irrational number is a number that cannot be written as a ratio \\(x/y\\) form (or fraction). In decimal form, it never ends or repeats. Examples for irrational numbers are \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213......\\), \\(\\pi = 3.14159265.......\\), \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) etc. 1.1.6 Integers All numbers that do not have the decimal places in them are called integers. \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{...,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,...\\}\\) i.e it may be positive or negative or zero. Integers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Any integers are added, subtracted, or multiplied the result is always is an integer. When any integers multiplied , each of the multiplied integer is called a factor or divisor of the resulting product. 1.1.7 Whole numbers The set of whole numbers means narrator numbers and \\(0\\) Whole numbers = \\(\\mathbb{W} = \\{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...\\}\\) 1.1.8 Natural numbers The counting numbers start with 1 and their end is not defined. i.e \\(\\mathbb{N} =\\{1,2,3,4,...\\}\\) Further Reading : Dass, H.

The four most common number system types are: Decimal number system (Base- 10) Binary number system (Base- 2) Octal number system (Base-8) Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16) System Radix/ Base Digits Binary 2 0 1 Octal 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Decimal 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Hexadecimal 16 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 1.2.2 Decimal Number System The Decimal number system is a number of base or radix equal to 10. To determine the actual number in each position, take the number that appears in the position and multiply it by \\(10^x\\), where \\(x\\) is the power representation. Example 1: The value of the combination of symbols 453 is determined by adding the weights of each position as \\[4\\times10^2+5\\times10^1+3\\times10^0\\] \\[= 4\\times100 + 5\\times10+3\\times1\\] Or \\[= 400+50+3 = 453\\] Example 2: The value of the combination of symbols 369.54 is determined by adding the weights of each position as \\[3\\times10^2+6\\times10^1+9\\times10^0+5\\times10^{-1}+4\\times10^{-2}\\] Or \\[= 300 + 60+9+\\frac{5}{10}+\\frac{4}{100}\\] Or \\[= 300 + 60+9+0.5+0.04= 369.54\\] 1.2.3 Binary Number System The binary number system is a number system of base or radix equal to 2. In the binary number system, there are two symbols to represent number: 0 and 1 When the symbols 0 an 1 are used to represent binary number, each symbol is called a binary digit or a bit. Therefore, the binary number 1011 is a four-digit number or a 4-bit binary number. 1.2.3.1 Binary-to-Decimal Conversion Multiply binary digit (1 or 0) in each position by the weight of the position and add the results. Example 1: Convert the binary number 11010 to its decimal equivalent Example 2: Convert the binary number 0.011 to its decimal equivalent Example 3: Convert the binary number 110.011 to its decimal equivalent 1.2.3.2 Decimal-to-Binary Conversion To convert decimal numbers to their binary equivalent, the following procedures are employed: 1.2.3.2.1 Whole number conversion: Repeated division by 2 The remainder resulting from each division forms binary number. The first remainder to be produced is called the least significant bit (LSB) and the last remainder is called most significant bit (MSB). Example 1: Convert the decimal number 17 to binary 1.2.3.2.2 Fractional number conversion: Repeated multiplication by 2 Multiply any factional part repeatedly by 2. The equivalent binary number is formed from the 1 or 0 in the units position (\\(10^0\\) position). Example 1: Convert the decimal number 0.625 to binary Sometimes it will be necessary to terminate the multiplication when an acceptable degree of accuracy is obtained. Then the resulted binary number will be an approximation. Example 2: Convert the decimal number 0.6375 to binary We see that it continues in this way and does not terminate. So, \\(0.6375_{10} = (0.1010001101....)_{2}\\). If we discard all the bits after the 7th bit, then we get the approximate representation \\(0.6375_{10} \\approx (0.1010001)_{2},\\) committing an error amounting to \\[0.6375_{10} -(0.1010001)_{2}= 0.6375_{10} -0.6328125_{10}= (.0046875)_{10},\\] which is known as round-off error. Although, strictly, this is chopping-off error, it is generally, termed as round-off error. Example 3: Convert the decimal number 49.683 to binary 1.2.4 Octal Number System The octal system is a number system of base or radix equal to 8. 1.2.4.1 Octal-to-Decimal Conversion Example 1: Convert the following octal numbers to their decimal equivalent \\(35_8\\) \\(100_8\\) \\(0.24_8\\) 1.2.4.2 Decimal-to-Octal Conversion To convert decimal numbers to their octal equivalent, the following procedures are employed: 1.2.4.2.1 Whole number conversion: Repeated division by 8 Example 1: Convert the decimal number 245 to octal equivalent 1.2.4.2.2 Fractional number conversion: Repeated multiplication by 8 Example 2: Convert the decimal fraction 0.432 to octal equivalent This conversion to octal is not precise as there is a remainder. If greater accuracy is required, continue multiplying by 8 to obtain more octal digits. Example 3: Convert the decimal number 419.95 to octal equivalent 1.2.4.3 Octal-to-Binary Conversion Octal and binary number correspondence Octal Binary 0 000 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 To convert from octal to binary, simply replace each octal digit with the corresponding three-digit binary number. Example 1: Convert the following octal numbers to their binary equivalent \\(247_8\\) \\(124.375_8\\) 1.2.4.4 Binary-to-Octal Conversion To convert from binary to octal, subdivide the number into groups of three bits, proceeding both left and right from the binary point, and if necessary padding the last group with zero. The octal representation of each group gives the required octal number. Example 1: Convert the binary number 11010101.01101 to its octal equivalent 1.2.5 Hexadecimal Number System The Hexadecimal system is a number system of base or radix equal to 16. Hexadecimal is similar to the octal numeral system because each can be easily compared to the binary numeral system. Example values of hexadecimal numbers converted into binary, octal and decimal. Hexadecimal Binary Octal Decimal 0 0000 0 0 1 0001 1 1 2 0010 2 2 3 0011 3 3 4 0100 4 4 5 0101 5 5 6 0110 6 6 7 0111 7 7 8 1000 10 8 9 1001 11 9 A 1010 12 10 B 1011 13 11 C 1100 14 12 D 1101 15 13 E 1110 16 14 F 1111 17 15 1.2.5.1 Hexadecimal-to-Decimal Conversion Example 1: Convert the following octal numbers to their decimal equivalent \\(C7_{16}\\) \\(2F_{16}\\) 1.2.5.2 Decimal-to-Hexadecimal Conversion To convert decimal numbers to their hexadecimal equivalent, the following procedures are employed: 1.2.5.2.1 Whole number conversion: Repeated division by 16 Example 1: Convert the decimal number 245 to Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.2.2 Fractional number conversion: Repeated multiplication by 16 Example 2: Convert the decimal fraction 0.0738 to Hexadecimal equivalent Example 3: Convert the decimal number 420.0095 to Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.3 Hexadecimal-to-Binary Conversion To convert from Hexadecimal to binary, simply replace each Hexadecimal digit with the corresponding four-digit binary number. Example 1: Convert the following Hexadecimal numbers to their binary equivalent \\(7B_{16}\\) \\(6D.8C_{16}\\) 1.2.5.4 Binary-to-Hexadecimal Conversion To convert from binary to Hexadecimal, subdivide the number into groups of four bits. The hexadecimal representation of each group then gives the hexadecimal representation. Example 1: Convert the binary number 11010101.01101 to its Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.5 Octal-to-Hexadecimal Conversion First convert octal to binary, and then convert binary to hexadecimal. Example 1: Convert the octal number 365.52 to its Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.5.6 Hexadecimal-to-octal conversion First convert Hexadecimal to binary, and then convert binary to octal. Example 1: Convert the octal number D2B.284 to its Hexadecimal equivalent 1.2.6 Binary Arithmetic The arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of binary numbers follow the rules as summarized below Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division \\(0+0 = 0\\) \\(0-0=0\\) \\(0\\times0=0\\) \\(\\frac{0}{1} = 0\\) \\(0+1 = 1\\) \\(1-0=1\\) \\(0\\times1=0\\) \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\) \\(1+0 = 1\\) \\(1-1 = 0\\) \\(1\\times0=0\\) \\(\\frac{0}{0} = undefined\\) \\(1+1 = 10\\) \\(1-0 = 10-1 =1\\) \\(1\\times1=1\\) \\(\\frac{1}{0} = undefined\\) 1.2.6.1 Binary Addition Example 1: Add (a) 111 and 101 (b) 1010, 1001 and 1101 1.2.6.2 Binary Subtraction Example 1: Perform the following subtractions \\(11- 01\\) (b) \\(11-10\\) (c) \\(100-011\\) When subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, the output will be negative. To perform this subtraction, subtract the smaller number from the larger number and prefix the output with the sign of the larger number. Example 2: Perform the following subtraction 101 - 111 1.2.6.3 Binary multiplication Example 1: Multiply the following binary numbers \\(101\\times11\\) (b) \\(1101\\times10\\) (c) \\(1010\\times101\\) \\(1011\\times1010\\) Multiplication of factional numbers is perform in the same manner as with decimal factional numbers. Example 2: Perform the binary multiplication \\(0.01\\times11\\) 1.2.6.4 Binary Division Example 1: Perform the following binary division \\(110\\div11\\) (b) \\(1100\\div11\\) (c) \\(1111\\div110\\) (d) \\(1100\\div101\\) References Butenko, S., &amp; Pardalos, P.

["sequences-and-series.html", "Chapter 2 Sequences and Series 2.1 Sequences 2.2 Series 2.3 Infinite Sequences 2.4 Infinite Series Tutorial", " Chapter 2 Sequences and Series 2.1 Sequences A Sequence is a list of numbers written in a definite order: \\[a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, ..., a_{n}\\] An element of a sequence is called a term . The number \\(a_{1}\\) is called the first term, \\(a_{2}\\) is the second term, and in general \\(a_{n}\\) is called the \\(n^{th}\\) term. As can be seen in the above sequence, for every positive integer \\(n\\) there is a corresponding number \\(a_{n}\\).Therefore a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. But we usually write \\(a_{n}\\) instead of the function notation \\(f(n)\\) for the value of the function at the number \\(n\\). When dealing with infinite sequences, each term \\(a_{n}\\) will have a successor \\(a_{n+1}\\) Notation: The sequence \\(\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},...\\}\\) is also denoted by \\[\\{a_{n}\\}\\] or \\[\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\] Some sequences can be defined by giving a formula for the \\(n\\)th term. In the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequences: by using the preceding notation by using the defining formula by writing out the terms of the sequence Notice that \\(n\\) doesn’t have to start at 1. \\(\\{\\frac{n}{n+1}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = \\frac{n}{n+1}\\hspace{5em}\\{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5},..., \\frac{n}{n+1},... \\}\\) \\(\\{\\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = \\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\\hspace{5em}\\{-\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{3}{9}, -\\frac{4}{27}, \\frac{5}{81},..., \\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}},... \\}\\) \\(\\{\\sqrt{n-3}\\}_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = \\sqrt{n-3}, n\\geq3\\hspace{5em}\\{0,1,\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3},..., \\sqrt{n-3},...\\}\\) \\(\\{cos\\frac{n\\pi}{6}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = cos\\frac{n\\pi}{6}, n\\geq 0 \\hspace{5em}\\{1, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},\\frac{1}{2}, 0,...,cos\\frac{n\\pi}{6},...\\}\\) 2.2 Series A series is the sum of a number of terms of a sequence. When writing series, the shorthand \\(\\sum\\) notation is used to represent the sum of a number of terms having a common form. The series \\(f(1)+ f(2)+\\dots+ f(n−1)+ f(n)\\) can be written as \\[\\sum_{r=1}^nf(r).\\] 2.2.1 Arithmetic sequences and series A sequence in which each term after the first term is obtained from the preceding term by adding a fixed number (Common difference), is called an arithmetic sequence or Arithmetic Progression. The sequence defined by \\[u_1=a \\text{ and } u_n=u_{n-1} + d \\text{ for } n\\geq2\\] gives \\[a,a+d, a+2d,\\dots\\] The \\(n\\)th term (i.e. the solution) is given by \\(u_n = a + (n −1)d\\). This is the arithmetic sequence with first term \\(a\\) and common difference \\(d\\) The arithmetic series with \\(n\\) terms \\[a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+\\dots+ [a+(n-1)d]\\] has sum \\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(\\text{first term} + \\text{ last term)}\\] \\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)\\] 2.2.2 Geometric sequences and series The sequence defined by \\[u_1=a \\text{ and } u_n=ru_{n-1} \\text{ for } n\\geq2\\] gives \\[a,ar, ar^2,\\dots\\] The \\(n\\)th term is given by \\(u_n = ar^{n −1}\\). This is the geometric sequence with first term \\(a\\) and common ratio \\(r\\). The geometric series with \\(n\\) terms \\[a+ar+ar^2+\\dots+ ar^{n-1}\\] has sum \\[S_n = \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} \\text{ or } \\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1} \\text{ for } r\\neq1\\] Important results relating to the \\(\\sum\\) notation \\[\\sum_{r=1}^n\\{f(r)+ g(r)\\} = \\{f(1)+ g(1)\\}+ \\{f(2)+ g(2)\\}+\\dots + \\{f(n)+ g(n)\\}\\] \\[= \\{f(1)+ f(2)+ \\dots+ f(n)\\}+ \\{g(1)+ g(2)+\\dots +g(n)\\}\\] \\[= \\sum_{r=1}^nf(r)+ \\sum_{r=1}^ng(r)\\] \\[\\sum_{r=1}^naf(r)= af(1)+ af(2)+ \\dots+ af(n)\\] where \\(a\\) is a constant. \\[=a\\{f(1)+ f(2)+ \\dots+ f(n)\\}\\] \\[=a\\sum_{r=1}^nf(r)\\] \\(\\sum_{r=1}^nr=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) \\(\\sum_{r=1}^nr^2=\\frac{n}{6}(n+1)(2n+1)\\) \\(\\sum_{r=1}^nr^3=\\frac{n^2}{4}(n+1)^2\\) or \\(\\left[\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right]^2\\) \\(\\sum_{r=1}^n1=(1+1+\\dots+1) = n\\) 2.2.3 Methods of proof Mathematical induction The difference method 2.2.3.1 Mathematical induction Let \\(n\\) be a natural number. Then the aim is to show that some statement \\(P(n)\\) involving \\(n\\) is true for any \\(n\\). The following steps are used in Mathematical induction Let \\(P(n)\\) be a statement Show that the statement is true for \\(P(1)\\) and \\(P(2)\\). (i.e. \\(P(n)\\) is true for \\(n=1\\) and \\(n=2.\\)) Assume that \\(P(k)\\) is true (i.e. \\(P(n)\\) is true for \\(n=k\\)). Show that \\(P(k+1)\\) follows from \\(P(k).\\) 2.2.3.2 The difference method The process of proof by induction is a powerful mathematical tool. However it has the disadvantage that, in order to employ the method it requires the answer. There are, however, direct methods of proof such as the method of differences, or the difference method. The difference method can be summarised as follows, \\[\\sum_{r=1}^n \\left\\{f(r)-f(r-1) \\right\\} = f(n) - f(0)\\] where \\(f\\) is any function suitably defined on the non-negative integers. This is also know as the fundamental theorem of summation: 2.3 Infinite Sequences When dealing with infinite sequences, each term \\(a_{n}\\) will have a successor \\(a_{n+1}\\) Definition: Convergence and Divergence A sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) has the limit \\(L\\) and we write \\[\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}a_n=L \\text{ or } a_n \\rightarrow L \\text{ as } n\\rightarrow \\infty\\] if we can make the term \\(a_n\\) as close to L as \\(n\\) becomes sufficiently large. If \\(\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}a_n\\) exists, we say the sequence converges (or is convergent). If \\(\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}a_n\\) does not exist, we say the sequence diverges (or is divergent). 2.3.1 Limit Laws for Sequences If \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) and \\(\\{b_n\\}\\) are convergent sequences and \\(c\\) is a constant, then \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}(a_n+ b_n)= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n+ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}b_n\\) \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}(a_n- b_n)= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n- \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}b_n\\) \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}ca_n= c \\;\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n\\) \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}c= c\\) \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}(a_nb_n)= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n. \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}b_n\\) \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\frac{a_n}{b_n}= \\frac{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n} {\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}b_n} \\text{ if } \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}{b_n} \\neq 0\\) \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}(a_n)^p= [\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n]^p \\text{ if } p&gt;0 \\text{ and } a_n&gt;0\\) Squeeze Theorem for Sequences If \\(a_n \\leq b_n \\leq c_n\\) for \\(n\\geq n_0\\) and \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}c_n= L,\\) then \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}b_n=L\\) Theorem: \\[\\text{If }\\;\\; \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}|a_n|=0, \\text{ then } \\;\\;\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n=0.\\] Theorem The sequence \\(\\{r^n\\}\\) is convergent if \\(-1 &lt;r\\leq1\\) and divergent for all other values of \\(r\\). \\[\\begin{equation} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}r^n= \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{if } -1&lt;r&lt;1\\\\ 1 &amp; \\text{if } r=1 \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Definition A sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) is called increasing if \\(a_n&lt;a_{n+1}\\) for all \\(n \\geq 1,\\) that is, \\(a_1&lt;a_2&lt;a_3&lt;\\dots.\\) It is called decreasing if \\(a_n&gt;a_{n+1}\\) for all \\(n\\geq 1.\\) It is called monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing. Definition If there exists a number \\(m\\) such that \\(m \\leq a_n\\) for every \\(n\\) we say the sequence is bounded below. The number \\(m\\) is sometimes called a lower bound for the sequence. If there exists a number \\(M\\) such that \\(a_n \\leq M\\) for every \\(n\\) we say the sequence is bounded above. The number \\(M\\) is sometimes called an upper bound for the sequence. If the sequence is both bounded below and bounded above we call the sequence bounded. 2.4 Infinite Series Consider the infinite sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty\\). Consider the partial sums \\[\\begin{align*} s_1=a_1 \\\\ s_2=a_1+a_2 \\\\ s_3=a_1+a_2+a_3 \\\\ s_4=a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4 \\\\ &amp;\\vdots\\\\ s_n=a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+\\dots +a_n =\\sum_{i=1}^na_i \\end{align*}\\] These partial sums form a new sequence \\(\\{s_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty,\\) which may or may not have a limit. Consider the limit of the sequence of partial sums, \\(\\{s_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty.\\) \\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_n= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^na_i=\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i\\] This \\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i\\) (\\(=a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+\\dots +a_n \\dots\\)) is called an infinite series Definition Consider the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n= =a_1+a_2+a_3+\\dots.\\) Let \\(s_n\\) denote its \\(n\\)th partial sum: \\[s_n= \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i= a_1+a_2+\\dots +a_n\\] If the sequence \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) is convergent and \\(\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}s_n=s\\) exist as a real number, then the series \\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i\\) is called convergent and we write, \\(a_1+a_2+\\dots +a_n+\\dots=s\\) or \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n=s\\) The number \\(s\\) is called the sum of the series. If the sequence of partial sums is divergent then the infinite series is also called divergent. Geometric Series An important example of an infinite series is the geometric series \\[\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty ar^{n-1}=a+ar+ar^2+\\dots\\] is convergent if \\(|r|&lt;1\\) and its sum is \\[\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty ar^{n-1}= \\frac{a}{1-r}\\qquad\\qquad|r|&lt;1\\] If \\(|r|\\geq1,\\) the geometric series is divergent. Theorem If the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n\\) is convergent, then \\(\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}a_n=0.\\) Proof Note 1 Consider any series \\(\\sum a_n.\\) This associates two sequences the sequence \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) of its partial sums the sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) of its terms. If \\(\\sum a_n\\) is convergent, then the limit of the sequence \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) is \\(s\\) (the sum of the series) the limit of the sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) is 0. Note 2 - The converse of the above theorem is not true in general. The Test for Divergence If \\(\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}a_n\\) does not exist or if \\(\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}a_n \\neq0\\), then the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n\\) is divergent. Theorem If \\(\\sum a_n\\) and \\(\\sum b_n\\) are convergent series, then \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty ca_n= c\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\;\\;\\) \\(c\\) is a constant. \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (a_n+b_n)= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n+ \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n\\) \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (a_n-b_n)= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n- \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n\\) Reading: Stewart, J., Clegg, D.

The truth value True and False are denoted by the symbols T and F, respectively. Sometimes it is also denoted by 1 (stands for true) and 0 (stands for false). Since it depends on only two possible truth values, it is known as two-values logic of bi-values logic. Example 1 Consider the following sentences and select the statements Man is Mortal 12 plus 9 is equal to 1 Moon rises in the east 3 is less than four Please sit down \\(y\\) is a cat 14 is a composite number Chaddy is a nice dog. 3.2 Propositional Variables Every statement in propositional logic consists of propositional variables combined via propositional connectives. Propositional variables are usually denoted by capital English letters, such as P, Q, R etc. Each variable can take one of two values: T or F. 3.3 Logical Connectives We use logical connectives to connect the propositional variables (several statements into a single statement). The most basic and fundamental connectives are Negation, Conjunction and Disjunction. 3.3.1 Negation Negation is the simplest common example of a truth-functional operation. The negation of a statement is also a statement. We use the connective Not for negation. If \\(P\\) be a statement, then the negation of \\(P\\) is denoted by \\(\\neg P\\). \\(P\\) and \\(\\neg P\\) has opposite truth values. The relationship between the truth values of \\(P\\) and \\(\\neg P\\) can be made explicit by a diagram called a truth table Truth Table (Negation) \\(P\\) \\(\\neg P\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) 3.3.2 Conjunction The conjunction of two statements, \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is also a statement. We use the connective And (\\(\\land\\)) for conjunction. It is denoted by \\(P \\land Q\\) Truth Table (Conjunction) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\((P \\land Q)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) Rule: \\((P \\land Q)\\) is true if both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are true, otherwise false. In order to make \\((P \\land Q)\\) true, \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have to be simultaneously true 3.3.3 Disjunction The disjunction of two statements, \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is also a statement. We use the connective Or (\\(\\lor\\)) for disjunction It is denoted by \\(P \\lor Q\\) Truth Table (Disjunction) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\((P \\lor Q)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) Rule: \\((P \\lor Q)\\) is true if either \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) is true and it is false when both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are false. \\((P \\lor Q)\\) shall stand for “\\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) or both”. 3.4 Conditional In mathematics, expressions of the form “IF \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\)” occur so often. This can be expressed in any one of the following forms. If \\(P\\), then \\(Q\\) \\(P\\) only if \\(Q\\) \\(P\\) implies \\(Q\\) \\(Q\\) if \\(P\\) Therefore, it is important to understand the corresponding truth-functional operation. Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. Then the statement \\(P \\rightarrow Q\\) is called a conditional statement. In an implication \\(P \\rightarrow Q\\), \\(P\\) is called the antecedent (hypothesis) and \\(Q\\) is called the consequent (conclusion). Truth Table (Conditional) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\((P \\rightarrow Q)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) Rule: An implication (conditional) \\((P \\rightarrow Q)\\) is False only when the hypothesis (\\(P\\)) is true and conclusion (\\(Q\\)) is false, otherwise True. 3.5 Bi-Conditional Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. Then the statement \\(P \\leftrightarrow Q\\) is called a bi-conditional statement. This can be expressed in any one of the following forms. \\(P\\) if and only if \\(Q\\) \\(P\\) is necessary and sufficient of \\(Q\\) \\(P\\) is necessary and sufficient for \\(Q\\) \\(P\\) implies \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) is implied by \\(Q\\) The bi-conditional (double implication) \\(P \\leftrightarrow Q\\) can be defined as \\[P \\leftrightarrow Q: (P \\rightarrow Q) \\land (Q \\rightarrow P)\\] Truth Table (Bi-Conditional) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\((P \\rightarrow Q)\\) \\((Q \\rightarrow P)\\) \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) Rule: \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q)\\) is True only when both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have identical truth values, otherwise false. 3.6 Converse Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. The converse statement of the conditional \\(P \\rightarrow Q\\) is given as \\(Q \\rightarrow P\\) 3.7 Inverse Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. The inverse statement of the conditional \\((P \\rightarrow Q)\\) is given as \\((\\lnot P \\rightarrow \\lnot Q)\\) 3.8 Contra Positive Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. The contra positive statement of the conditional \\((P \\rightarrow Q)\\) is given as \\((\\lnot Q \\rightarrow \\lnot P)\\) Truth Table (Contra Positive) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\(P \\rightarrow Q\\) \\(\\lnot Q\\) \\(\\lnot P\\) \\((\\lnot Q \\rightarrow \\lnot P)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) From the truth table it can be seen that both conditional \\(P \\rightarrow Q\\) and contra positive \\((\\lnot Q \\rightarrow \\lnot P)\\) have same truth values. 3.9 Exclusive OR Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. The exclusive OR of two statements \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is denoted by \\((P \\overline{\\lor} Q)\\). We use the connective XOR for exclusive OR The exclusive OR \\((P \\overline{\\lor} Q)\\) is true if either \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) is True but not both. The exclusive OR is also known as exclusive disjunction. the conditional \\((P \\rightarrow Q)\\) is given as \\((\\lnot Q \\rightarrow \\lnot P)\\) Truth Table (Exclusive OR) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\((P \\overline{\\lor}Q)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) Rule: \\((P \\overline{\\lor}Q)\\) is true if either \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) is True but not both, otherwise false. 3.10 NAND The word NAND stands for NOT and AND. The connective NAND is denoted by the symbol \\(\\uparrow\\). Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. The NAND of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is denoted by \\((P \\uparrow Q)\\). The NAND, \\((P \\uparrow Q)\\) can be defined as \\[(P\\uparrow Q)\\equiv\\lnot(P \\land Q)\\] Truth Table (NAND) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\((P \\uparrow Q)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) Rule: \\((P \\uparrow Q)\\) is True if either \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) is false, otherwise False 3.11 NOR The word NOR stands for NOT and OR. The connective NOR is denoted by the symbol \\(\\downarrow\\). Let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be any two statements. The NOR of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is denoted by \\((P \\downarrow Q)\\). The NOR, \\((P \\downarrow Q)\\) can be defined as \\[(P\\downarrow Q)\\equiv\\lnot(P \\lor Q)\\] Truth Table (NOR) \\(P\\) \\(Q\\) \\((P \\downarrow Q)\\) \\(T\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(F\\) \\(T\\) Rule: \\((P \\downarrow Q)\\) is True only when both \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) are false, otherwise False 3.12 Tautology If the truth values of a composite statement are always true, irrespective of the truth values of the atomic (individual) statements, then it is a tautology. Example The composite statement \\((P\\land (P \\rightarrow Q)) \\rightarrow Q\\) is a tautology. Verify this using a truth table with composite statement as \\((P\\land (P \\rightarrow Q)) \\rightarrow Q\\) 3.13 Contradiction If the truth values of a composite statement are always false, irrespective of the truth values of the atomic (individual) statements, then it is a contradiction or unsatisfiable. Example The composite statement \\(\\lnot(P\\rightarrow(Q\\rightarrow(P\\land Q)))\\) is a contradiction. Verify this using a truth table with composite statement as \\(\\lnot(P\\rightarrow(Q\\rightarrow(P\\land Q)))\\) 3.14 Satisfiable If the truth values of a composite statement are sometimes true and sometimes false, irrespective of the truth values of the atomic statements, then it is called a satisfiable. Example The composite statement \\((P \\rightarrow Q) \\rightarrow (Q \\rightarrow P)\\) is satisfiable. Verify this using a truth table of \\((P \\rightarrow Q) \\rightarrow (Q \\rightarrow P)\\) 3.15 Duality Law Two formulae \\(P\\) and \\(p^*\\)are said to be duals of each other if either one can be obtained from the other by interchanging \\(\\land\\) by \\(\\lor\\) and \\(\\lor\\) by \\(\\land\\). The two connectives \\(\\lor\\) and \\(\\land\\) are called dual to each other. Example The formulae \\(P \\equiv (P \\lor Q)\\land R\\) and \\(P^* \\equiv (P \\land Q)\\lor R\\) are dual to each other. 3.16 Algebra of Propositions If \\(P, Q\\) and \\(R\\) be three statements, then the following laws hold.

He introduced symbolic logic known as Boolean Algebra, Boolean function, Boolean expression, Boolean ring etc. Each variable in Boolean Algebra has either of two values: true or false. The purpose of Boolean Algebra is to solve logic problems. C.E Shannon observed that Boolean Algebra could be used to analyze electronic circuits. 4.1 Gates In Chapter 3 we discussed about logic connectives \\(\\lnot\\), \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\lor\\). The connectives \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\lor\\) can be considered as circuits connected in series and parallel, respectively. A circuit with one or more input signals but only one output signal is known as a gate. Gates are digital circuits because of input and output signals, which are either low or high. Gates are also known as logical circuits as they can be analyzed with Boolean Algebra. In gates, the connectives \\(\\lnot\\), \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\lor\\) are usually denoted by the symbols \\(^\\prime, \\;\\;.\\) and \\(+\\), respectively. 4.1.1 NOT gate A NOT gate receives input \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is a bit (binary digit) and produces output \\(x^\\prime\\) where \\[\\begin{equation} x^\\prime = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x=0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } x=1 \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] \\(x^\\prime\\) is called the complement of \\(x\\). 0 is called the zero element. 1 is called the unit element. The output state is always the opposite of the input state. The output is also known as the complement of the input. The block diagram and the logic table for the basic NOT gate: 4.1.2 AND gate An AND gate receives input \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), where \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are bits, and produces output \\((x_1 \\land x_2)\\) where \\[\\begin{equation} (x_1 \\land x_2) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x_1=x_2=1\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{ Otherwise } \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] \\((x_1 \\land x_2)\\) is called the meet of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). An AND gate can have more than two inputs, but only one output. The block diagram and the logic table for the basic AND gate: 4.1.3 OR gate An OR gate receives input \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), where \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are bits, and produces output \\((x_1 \\lor x_2)\\) where \\[\\begin{equation} (x_1 \\lor x_2) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x_1 \\text{ or } x_2=1\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{ Otherwise } \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] \\((x_1 \\lor x_2)\\) is called the join of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).

The block diagram and the logic table for the basic NAND gate: 4.1.4.3 XOR gate (Exclusive OR gate) A XOR gate receives input \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), where \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are bits, and produces output \\((x_1 \\overline{\\lor} x_2)\\) or \\((x_1 \\oplus x_2)\\), where \\[\\begin{equation} (x_1 \\oplus x_2)^\\prime = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x_1 =1 \\text{ or } x_2=1 \\text{ but not both}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{ Otherwise } \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Rule: XOR gate produces 1 that have an odd number of 1’s. A XOR gate can have more than two inputs, but only one output. The block diagram and the logic table for the basic XOR gate: 4.1.4.4 XNOR gate (Exclusive NOR gate) A XNOR gate receives input \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), where \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are bits, and produces output \\((x_1\\text{ XNOR }x_2)\\), where \\[\\begin{equation} (x_1 \\text{ XNOR } x_2)^\\prime = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x_1 \\text{ and } x_2 \\text{ are same bits}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{ Otherwise } \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] A XNOR gate can have more than two inputs, but only one output. It can recognize even-parity words i.e a word which has an even number of 1’s. Example: 11001111 is even-parity as it contains six 1’s, 1110 is an odd-parity as it has an odd number of 1’s. The block diagram and the logic table for the basic XNOR gate: 4.2 Combinatorial Circuit A combinatorial circuit produces a unique output for every combination of inputs. A combinatorial circuit has no memory, previous inputs and the state of the system do not affect the output of a combinatorial circuit. These circuits can be constructed using gates which we have already discussed. 4.3 Boolean Expression Any expression built up from the variables \\(x_1,y_1,z_1, x_2,y_2,z_2,\\dots\\) by applying the operations \\(\\land, \\; \\lor\\) and \\(^\\prime\\) a finite number of times is called a Boolean expression. If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are two Boolean expressions, then \\(X^\\prime, \\;Y^\\prime, \\; (X\\land Y)\\) and \\((X\\lor Y)\\) are also Boolean expressions. The output of a combinatorial circuit is also a Boolean expression. Example 4.3.1 Theorem If \\(\\land, \\; \\lor\\) and \\(^\\prime\\) are connectives introduced earlier, then the following properties hold. Associative Law: For all \\(a,b,c \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) \\[(a \\land b) \\land c = a \\land (b\\land c) \\text{ and } (a \\lor b) \\lor c = a \\lor (b\\lor c)\\] Identity Law: For all \\(a \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) \\[(a \\land 1) = a \\text{ and } (a \\lor 0) = a\\] Commutative Law: For all \\(a,b\\in \\{0,1\\}\\) \\[(a \\land b) = (b \\land a) \\text{ and } (a \\lor b) = (b \\lor a)\\] Complement Law: For all \\(a\\in \\{0,1\\}\\) \\[(a \\land a^\\prime) = 0 \\text{ and } (a \\lor a^\\prime) = 1\\] Distributive Law: For all \\(a,b,c\\in \\{0,1\\}\\) \\[a \\lor (b\\land c) = (a \\lor b) \\land (a \\lor c) \\text{ and } a \\land (b\\lor c)= (a \\land b) \\lor (a \\land c)\\] De-Morgan’s Law: If \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are bits, i.e. \\(x_1, x_2\\in \\{0,1\\},\\) then \\[(x_1 \\land x_2)^\\prime = x_1^\\prime \\lor x_2^\\prime \\text{ and } (x_1 \\lor x_2)^\\prime = x_1^\\prime \\land x_2^\\prime \\] 4.4 Equivalent Combinatorial Circuits Two combinatorial circuits, each having inputs \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\) are said to be equivalent if they produce the same output for same inputs. 4.5 Boolean Algebra A Boolean algebra consists of a set \\(S\\) together with two binary operations \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\lor\\) on \\(S\\), a singular operation \\(^\\prime\\) on \\(S\\) and two specific elements 0 and 1 of \\(S\\) such that the following laws hold. A Boolean algebra will be designated by a hextuple \\(B = \\langle S, \\land, \\lor, ^\\prime, 0,1\\rangle\\) Sometimes one refers to the set \\(S\\) as a Boolean algebra, but this is just a loose misuse of language. Associative Law: For all \\(a,b,c \\in S\\) \\[(a \\land b) \\land c = a \\land (b\\land c) \\text{ and } (a \\lor b) \\lor c = a \\lor (b\\lor c)\\] Identity Law: For all \\(a \\in S\\) \\[(a \\land 1) = a \\text{ and } (a \\lor 0) = a\\] Commutative Law: For all \\(a,b\\in S\\) \\[(a \\land b) = (b \\land a) \\text{ and } (a \\lor b) = (b \\lor a)\\] Complement Law: For all \\(a\\in S\\) \\[(a \\land a^\\prime) = 0 \\text{ and } (a \\lor a^\\prime) = 1\\] Distributive Law: For all \\(a,b,c\\in S\\) \\[a \\lor (b\\land c) = (a \\lor b) \\land (a \\lor c) \\text{ and } a \\land (b\\lor c)= (a \\land b) \\lor (a \\land c)\\] 4.5.1 Theorem In a Boolean algebra: if \\((a\\lor b) =1\\) and \\((a\\land b) =0,\\) then \\(b=a^\\prime,\\) i.e. the complement is unique 4.5.2 Theorem In a Boolean algebra \\(B = \\langle S, \\land, \\lor, ^\\prime, 0,1\\rangle\\); the following properties hold. Idempotent Law: For all \\(x \\in S\\) \\[(x \\lor x) =x \\text{ and } (x \\land x) =x\\] Bound Law: For all \\(x \\in S\\) \\[(x \\lor 1) =1 \\text{ and } (x \\land 0) =0\\] Absorption Law: For all \\(x,y \\in S\\) \\[x \\land (x\\lor y) =x \\text{ and } x \\lor (x \\land y) =x \\] Involution Law: For all \\(x \\in S\\) \\[(x^\\prime)^\\prime =x \\] 0 and 1 Law: \\(0^\\prime =1\\) and \\(1^\\prime =0\\) De-Morgan’s Law: For all \\(x, y \\in S\\) \\[(x \\land y)^\\prime = x^\\prime \\lor y^\\prime \\text{ and } (x \\lor y)^\\prime = x^\\prime \\land y^\\prime \\] 4.6 Dual of a Statement The dual of a statement involving Boolean expressions is obtained by replacing 0 by 1, 1 by 0, \\(\\land\\) by \\(\\lor\\), and \\(\\lor\\) by \\(\\land\\). Two Boolean expressions are said to be dual of each other if one expression is obtained from other by replacing 0 by 1, 1 by 0, \\(\\land\\) by \\(\\lor\\), and \\(\\lor\\) by \\(\\land\\). In Boolean Algebra, the dual of a theorem is also a theorem. Example What the dual of the statement: \\((x \\land y)^\\prime = x^\\prime \\lor y^\\prime\\) 4.7 Boolean Function Let \\(B = \\langle S, \\land, \\lor, ^\\prime, 0,1\\rangle\\) be a Boolean algebra and let \\(X(x_1, x_2,x_3, \\dots, x_n)\\) be a Boolean expression in \\(n\\) variables. A function \\(f: B^n \\rightarrow B\\) is called a Boolean function if \\(f\\) is of the form \\(f(x_1, x_2,x_3, \\dots, x_n) = X(x_1, x_2,x_3, \\dots, x_n)\\) Example Consider the Boolean function \\(f: B^3 \\rightarrow B; \\;\\; B = \\{0,1\\}\\) defined by \\[f(x_!,x_2,x_3) = x_1 \\land (x_2 \\lor \\bar{x_3})\\] 4.7.1 Representation of Boolean Functions There are several ways of representing Boolean functions. Tabular representation \\(n\\) Space representation Cube representation Tabular representation A Boolean function is completely determined by its evaluation over any Boolean algebra. In tabular representation, we consider a row \\(R\\) of the table where the output is 1. We then form the combination \\((x_1 \\land x_2 \\land x_3 \\land \\dots \\land x_n)\\) and place a bar over each \\(x_i\\) whose value is 0 in row \\(R\\). The combination formed is 1 if and only if \\(x_i\\) have the value given in row \\(R\\). We thus join (OR) the terms to obtain the Boolean expression. Example \\(x_1\\) \\(x_2\\) \\(x_3\\) \\(f(x_1, x_2, x_3)\\) 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 4.8 Various Normal Forms 4.8.1 Disjunctive normal form A Boolean function \\(f: B^n \\rightarrow B\\) which consists of a sum of elementary products is called the disjunctive normal form of the given function \\(f\\) Let \\(f: B^n \\rightarrow B\\) is a Boolean function. If \\(f\\) is not identically zero, let \\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots, A_k\\) denote the elements \\(A_i\\) of \\(B_2^n,\\) for which \\(f(A_i) =1,\\) where \\[A_i = (a_1, a_2,\\dots, a_n).\\] For each \\(A_i\\) set \\(m_i = (y_1 \\land y_2 \\land y_3\\land \\dots \\land y_n)\\), where \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = \\begin{cases} x_i &amp; \\text{if } a_i=1\\\\ x_i^\\prime &amp; \\text{if } a_i=0. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Then \\(f(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots, x_n)= m_1 \\lor m_2 \\lor m_3 \\lor \\dots \\lor m_k.\\) This representation of a Boolean function is called the disjunctive normal form Example Consider the Boolean function \\((x_1 \\oplus x_2).\\) The truth table for this function is given below. \\(x_1\\) \\(x_2\\) \\((x_1 \\oplus x_2)\\) 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 Write the disjunctive form of this function 4.8.2 Conjunctive normal form A Boolean function \\(f: B^n \\rightarrow B\\) which consists of a product of elementary sums is called the conjunctive normal form of the given function \\(f\\) Let \\(f: B^n \\rightarrow B\\) is a Boolean function. If \\(f\\) is not identically one, let \\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots, A_k\\) denote the elements \\(A_i\\) of \\(B_2^n,\\) for which \\(f(A_i) =0,\\) where \\[A_i = (a_1, a_2,\\dots, a_n).\\] For each \\(A_i\\) set \\(M_i = (y_1 \\lor y_2 \\lor y_3\\lor \\dots \\lor y_n)\\), where \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = \\begin{cases} x_i &amp; \\text{if } a_i=0\\\\ x_i^\\prime &amp; \\text{if } a_i=1. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Then \\(f(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots, x_n)= M_1 \\land M_2 \\land M_3 \\land \\dots \\land M_k.\\) This representation of a Boolean function is called the conjunctive normal form Example Consider the Boolean function \\((x_1 \\oplus x_2).\\) The truth table for this function is given below. \\(x_1\\) \\(x_2\\) \\((x_1 \\oplus x_2)\\) 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 Write the conjunctive form of this function A term of the form \\((y_1\\land y_2 \\land y3 \\land \\dots \\land y_n),\\) where each \\(y_i\\) is either \\(x_i\\) or \\(\\bar{x_i}\\) is called a minterm.

Notice that Definition 2 differs from Definition 1 only in that we require \\(x\\) to be less than \\(a\\). Similarly, if we require that \\(x\\) be grater than \\(a\\), we get “the right-hand limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) is equal to \\(L\\)” and we write \\[lim_{x\\to a^+}f(x)=L\\] 5.0.1 Relationship between the limit and one-side limits \\[lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L \\;\\;\\;\\text{if and only if }\\;\\;\\; lim_{x\\to a^-}f(x)=L \\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\; lim_{x\\to a^+}f(x)=L\\] That is, \\[lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L \\Rightarrow lim_{x\\to a^-}f(x)= lim_{x\\to a^+}f(x)=L\\] \\[lim_{x\\to a^-}f(x)= lim_{x\\to a^+}f(x)=L \\Rightarrow lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\] \\[lim_{x\\to a^-}f(x) \\ne lim_{x\\to a^+}f(x) \\Rightarrow lim_{x\\to a}f(x) \\text{ Does Not Exist }\\] Properties Assume \\(lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\) and \\(lim_{x\\to a}g(x)\\) both exist and \\(c\\) is any number then, \\(lim_{x\\to a}[cf(x)] = c\\;lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\) \\(lim_{x\\to a}[f(x) \\pm g(x)] = lim_{x\\to a}f(x) \\pm lim_{x\\to a}g(x)\\) \\(lim_{x\\to a}[f(x)g(x)] = lim_{x\\to a}f(x) lim_{x\\to a}g(x)\\) \\(lim_{x\\to a}\\left[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right] = \\frac{lim_{x\\to a}f(x)}{lim_{x\\to a}g(x)}\\) provided \\(lim_{x\\to a}g(x) \\ne 0\\) \\(lim_{x\\to a}[f(x)]^n = [lim_{x\\to a}f(x)]^n\\) Continuous functions Definition3 A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a number \\(a\\) if \\[lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\] Notice that Definition 3 implicitly requires three things if \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(a\\): \\(f(a)\\) is defined (that is, \\(a\\) is in the domain of \\(f\\)) \\(lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\) exits \\(lim_{x\\to a}f(x) = f(a)\\) 5.1 Differentiation 5.1.1 Derivative and tangent lines 5.1.1.1 Geometric meaning of the derivative The steepness of a line can be determined by its slope. The steepness of the graph of a function (\\(f\\)) at a given point on it (say \\((x_0, f{(x_0)})\\)), can be approximated by its tangent line at that point. The slope of the tangent line at a point on the function is equal to the derivative of the function at that point The derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x_0\\) is denoted by \\(f^\\prime (x_0)\\) The direct computation of the slope of the tangent line is not possible as we are given only one point \\((x_0, f{(x_0)})\\). Instead, we consider the secant line through two points: \\((x_0, f{(x_0)})\\) and \\((x, f{(x)})\\), on the graph of \\(f\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(x_0\\), the secant line is approaching to the tangent line. As \\(x\\) varies, the secant line turns about the fixed point \\((x_0, f{(x_0)})\\). We can describe the tangent line as the limiting line of the secant line when \\(x\\) approaches \\(x_0\\) from either direction. As we move on the secant line from \\((x_0, f{(x_0)})\\) to \\((x, f{(x)})\\) the rise is \\(f(x) - f(x_0)\\) the run is \\(x - x_0\\). Therefore, \\[\\text{The slope of the secant line} = \\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} \\text{ for } x\\neq x_0.\\] To have the derivative be the slope of the tangent line, we define it as the limit of the slope of the secant line. Definition 1: Tangent line The tangent line to the curve \\(f\\) at the point \\((x_0, f(x_0))\\) is the line through that point with slope \\[m = lim_{x\\to x_{0}}\\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}\\] provided that this limit exists Definition 2 The derivative of a function \\(f\\) at \\(x_0\\) is \\[f^{\\prime}(x_0) = lim_{x\\to x_{0}}\\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x-x_0}\\] provided this limit exists and is finite. If this limit does not exist or if it is infinite, we say that \\(f\\) does not have a derivative at \\(x_{0}\\) Example 1 Compute the derivative of the function \\(x^2\\) at \\(x=1\\), using the definition of derivative The geometric interpretation of the above solution The derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at the point \\((1,1)\\). ( \\(f^\\prime(1) = 2\\)) The secant line has slope \\(x+1\\), and the limit of that slope as x tends to 1 is the slope 2 of the tangent line 5.1.1.2 Equations of the tangent lines When we compute the derivative, \\(f^\\prime(x_0)\\), we can give an equation for the tangent line at \\((x_0, f(x_0))\\) on the graph of \\(f\\). The tangent line has the equation \\[y-f(x_0)= f^\\prime(x_0)(x-x_0)\\] Example 2 Give the equation for the tangent line to the parabola \\(y=x^2\\) at \\(x=1\\). 5.1.1.3 Important properties 1. Differentiable functions are continuous A function must be continuous at any point where it has a derivative. Theorem If the derivative \\(f^\\prime(x_0)\\) exists, then the function \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x_{0}\\). 2. Continuous functions that do not have derivative The converse of the above theorem is false; that is, there are functions that are continuous but not differentiable. This usually occurs in one of the two ways: When the graph of \\(f\\) has a vertical tangent line at a given point. (The slope of the secant line \\(\\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x-x_0}\\) tends to \\(\\infty\\) or to \\(-\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) tends to \\(x_0\\)) When the secant line has different limits as \\(x\\) tends to \\(x_0\\) from the left and from the right (i.e. when the graph has a sharp corner or a cusp at \\(x=x_0\\)). The graph of a function will not have a tangent line at a point where the function is discontinuous. This graph does not have a tangent line at \\(x=x_{0}\\) Therefore, the function \\(f\\) does not have a derivative at \\(x_{0}\\). 5.1.2 Leibniz notation and derivative as a function Figure 5.1: Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz 5.1.2 Leibniz notation and derivative as a function In the Leibniz notation the derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x_0\\) is denoted by the symbol \\(\\frac{df}{dx}(x_0)\\) With Leibniz notation the definition of the derivative reads \\[\\frac{df}{dx}(x_0)= lim_{x\\to x_{0}}\\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}\\] We set \\(\\Delta x = x-x_0.\\) Then \\(x = x_0+ \\Delta x\\). Let \\(\\Delta f\\) for the change \\(f(x_0 + \\Delta x) - f(x_0)\\) in the value of \\(f\\) that occurs when we change \\(x\\) by \\(\\Delta x\\) from \\(x_0\\) to \\(x_0+\\Delta x\\) Then the slope of the secant line takes the form \\[\\frac{f(x_0 +\\Delta x)-f(x_0)}{\\Delta x }= \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x}.\\] Now the definition of the derivative reads \\[\\frac{df}{dx} (x_0) = lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x}= lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0 +\\Delta x)-f(x_0)}{\\Delta x }\\] Example 3 Use the above definition of the derivative to compute \\(\\frac{df}{dx}(3)\\) where \\(f(x)=x^2\\) 5.1.2.1 The derivative as a function So far we considered derivatives at a given value of x If we consider the derivative at a variable \\(x\\), we get the derivative function \\(\\frac{df}{dx}\\) whose value \\(\\frac{df}{dx}(x)\\) is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point \\((x, f(x)).\\) \\[\\frac{df}{dx}(x) =lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+\\Delta x) -f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\] 5.1.3 Derivatives of polynomials and exponential functions 5.1.3.1 Derivative of a constant function \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0\\] 5.1.3.2 Power functions We now look at the functions \\(f(x) = x^n\\). Pascal’s Triangle and the Binomial Theorem Binomial Expansions Using Pascal’s Triangle Consider the following expanded powers of \\((a + b)^n\\), where \\(a + b\\) is any binomial and \\(n\\) is a whole number. Look for patterns. \\((a+b)^0 = 1\\) \\((a+b)^1 = a+b\\) \\((a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2\\) \\((a+b)^3 = a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\\) \\((a+b)^4 = a^4+4a^3b+6a^2b^2+4ab^3+b^4\\) \\((a+b)^5 = a^5+5a^4b+10a^3b^2+10a^2b^3+5ab^4+b^5\\) Each expansion is a polynomial. Blaise Pascal found a numerical pattern, called Pascal’s Triangle Pascal’s Triangle gives us the coefficients for an expanded binomial of the form \\((a + b)^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the row of the triangle. Binomial Theorem According to the Binomial Theorem, if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any real numbers and \\(k\\) is a positive integer, then \\[(a+b)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}b+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2!}a^{n-2}b^2+ \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}a^{n-3}b^3 +\\] \\[\\dots + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\dots (n-k+1)}{n!}a^{n-k}b^k + \\dots + nab^{n-1}+b^n\\] The traditional notation for the binomial coefficients is \\[{n \\choose 0}=1\\] \\[{n \\choose k}=\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\dots (n-k+1)}{k!}\\] \\(n=1,2,\\dots, k\\) which enables us to write the Binomial Theorem in the abbreviated form \\[(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k }a^{n-k}b^k = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k }a^{k}b^{n-k}.\\] Example 1 \\(f(x)=x\\) Example 2 \\(f(x)=x^2\\) Example 3 \\(f(x)=x^3\\) Example 4 \\(f(x)=x^4\\) The Power Rule If \\(n\\) is a positive integer, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}\\] Functions with negative integer exponents Example 5 \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}\\) When the exponent is a fraction Example 6 \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) The Power Rule (General version) If \\(n\\) is any real number, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}\\] 5.1.3.3 The constant multiple rule If \\(c\\) is a constant and \\(f\\) is a differentiable function, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)]= c\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\\] Example 7 \\(f(x)=3x^4\\) 5.1.3.4 The Sum Rule If \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are both differentiable, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)]= \\frac{d}{dx}f(x)+ \\frac{d}{dx}g(x)\\] The Sum Rule is applicable to the sum of any number of functions 5.1.3.5 The Difference Rule If \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are both differentiable, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)-g(x)]= \\frac{d}{dx}f(x)- \\frac{d}{dx}g(x)\\] The Constant Multiple Rule, the Sum Rule and the Difference Rule can be combined with the Power Rule to differentiate any polynomial. Example 8 Differentiate \\(f(x)=x^4 - 6x^2+4\\) Find the points on the curve \\(f(x)=x^4-6x^2+4\\) where the tangent line is horizontal 5.1.3.6 Exponential Functions Exercise: Compute the derivative of the exponential function \\(f(x) = a^x\\) using th definition of a derivative Definition: Definition of the number \\(e\\) \\(e\\) is the number such that \\[lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{e^h -1}{h}=1\\] If we put \\(a=e\\) and , then, \\(f^\\prime(0)=1\\). Then derivative of the Natural Exponential Function \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)= e^x\\] Therefore, the exponential function, \\(f(x) = e^x\\) has the property that it is its own derivative. Geometrically, this means that the slope of the tangent line to the curve \\(f(x) = e^x\\) is equal to the y-coordinate of the point. Example 9 If \\(f(x)=e^x-x\\), find \\(f^\\prime(x)\\) 5.1.4 The product and quotient rules 5.1.4.1 The product rule If \\(f\\)and \\(g\\) are both differentiable, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)]= f(x)\\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]+ g(x)\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]\\] Example 10 If \\(f(x)=xe^x\\), find \\(f^\\prime(x)\\) 5.1.4.2 The quotient rule If \\(f\\)and \\(g\\) are both differentiable, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}]= \\frac{g(x)\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]- f(x)\\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]}{[g(x)]^2}\\] Example 11 If \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^2+x-2}{x^3+6}\\), find \\(f^\\prime(x)\\) 5.1.5 The chain rule If \\(y=f(u)\\) and \\(u=g(x)\\) are both differentiable functions, then \\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du}\\frac{du}{dx} \\] Example 12 If \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x^2+1}\\), find \\(f^\\prime(x)\\) using chain rule. 5.1.5.1 The power rule combined with the chain rule If \\(n\\) is any real number and \\(u=g(x)\\) is differentiable, then \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(u^n)= nu^{n-1}\\frac{du}{dx}\\] Alternatively, \\[\\frac{d}{dx}([g(x)]^n)= n[g(x)]^{n-1}\\frac{d}{dx}g(x)\\] Example 13 If \\(f(x)=(x^3-2)^{100}\\), find \\(f^\\prime(x)\\) Example 14 If \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{(x^2+x+1)^{1/3}}\\), find \\(f^\\prime(x)\\) 5.1.6 Partial Derivatives If \\(f\\) is a function of two variables, its partial derivatives are the functions \\(f_x\\) and \\(f_y\\) defined by \\[f_x=f_x(x,y)=lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}\\] \\[f_y=f_y(x,y)=lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}\\] There are many alternative notations for partial derivatives. Instead of \\(f_x\\), it can be written as \\(f_1\\) or \\(D_1f\\) to indicate that the differentiation is with respect to the first variable. Another notation is \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\). But here \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) can’t be interpreted as a ratio of differentials. Notations for Partial Derivatives If \\(z=f(x,y),\\) we write \\[f_x=f_x(x,y)= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}f(x,y)= \\frac{\\partial z }{\\partial x}= f_1=D_1f= D_xf \\] \\[f_y=f_y(x,y)= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}f(x,y)= \\frac{\\partial z }{\\partial y}= f_2=D_2f= D_yf \\] The partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) is just the ordinary derivative of the function of a single variable that we get by keeping \\(y\\) fixed. Therefore, we have the following rule. Rule for finding Partial Derivatives of \\(z=f(x,y)\\) To find \\(f_x\\), regard \\(y\\) as a constant and differentiate \\(f(x,y)\\) with respect to \\(x\\). To find \\(f_y\\), regard \\(x\\) as a constant and differentiate \\(f(x,y)\\) with respect to \\(y\\). Example 15 If \\(f(x,y)=x^3+x^2y^3-2y^2\\), find \\(f_x(2,1)\\) and \\(f_y(2,1)\\) 5.1.7 Higher Derivatives If \\(f\\) is a differentiable function, then its derivative \\(f^\\prime\\) is also a function. It is denoted by \\((f^\\prime)^\\prime = f^{\\prime\\prime}\\). This \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\) is called the second derivative of \\(f\\) as it is the derivative of the derivative of \\(f\\). Using Leibniz notation we can write the second derivative of \\(f\\) as follows: \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{dy}{dx})= \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\\] Another notation is \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}= D^2f(x)\\). We can interpret \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\) as the slope of the curve \\(y=f^{\\prime}(x)\\) at the point \\((x, f^\\prime(x))\\). In other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve \\(f(x)\\). The third derivative \\(f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\) is the derivative of the second derivative: \\(f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = (f^{\\prime\\prime})^\\prime\\). Therefore, \\(f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x)\\) can be interpreted as the slope of the curve \\(y= f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\) or as the rate of change of \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\) Alternative notations for the third derivative: \\[y^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x)=\\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})= \\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}= D^3f(x)\\] In general, the \\(n\\)th derivative of \\(f\\) is denoted by \\(f^{(n)}\\) and is obtained from \\(f\\) by differentiating \\(n\\) times. If \\(y=f(x)\\), \\[y^{(n)} = f^{(n)}(x)= \\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}= D^nf(x)\\] Example 16 If \\(f(x)=x^3-7x^2-3x+5\\) 5.1.8 Derivatives of logarithmic functions \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(a^x)= a^xln(a)\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(log_ax)= \\frac{1}{xln(a)}\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(lnx)= \\frac{1}{x}\\] Example 17 If \\(y=ln(x^3+1)\\) In general, if we combine derivatives of logarithmic functions with the chain rule. we get \\[\\frac{d}{dx}{ln\\text{ } u} = \\frac{1}{u}\\frac{du}{dx}\\] or \\[\\frac{d}{dx}{[ln\\text{ } g(x)]} = \\frac{g^\\prime (x)}{g(x)}\\] 5.1.9 Applications of differentiation 5.1.9.1 Maximum and minimum values 1. Definition A function \\(f\\) has an absolute maximum (or global maximum) at \\(c\\) if \\(f(c)\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(D\\), where \\(D\\) is the domain of \\(f\\). The number \\(f(c)\\) is called the maximum value of \\(f\\) on \\(D\\). Similarly, \\(f\\) has an absolute minimum (or global minimum) at \\(c\\) if \\(f(c)\\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(D\\) and the number \\(f(c)\\) is called the minimum value of \\(f\\) on \\(D\\). The maximum and minimum values of \\(f\\) are called the extreme values of \\(f\\). 2. Definition A function \\(f\\) has an local maximum (or relative maximum) at \\(c\\) if \\(f(c)\\geq f(x)\\) when \\(x\\) is near \\(c\\). [This means that \\(f(c)\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in some open interval containing \\(c\\)] Similarly, \\(f\\) has a local minimum (or relative minimum) at \\(c\\) if \\(f(c)\\leq f(x)\\) when \\(x\\) is near \\(c\\). Figure 5.2: Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz 3. The Extreme Value Theorem If \\(f\\) is continuous on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\), then \\(f\\) attains an absolute maximum value \\(f(c)\\) and an absolute minimum value \\(f(d)\\) at some numbers \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in \\([a,b]\\) A function need not possess extreme values if either hypothesis (continuity or closed interval) is omitted from the Extreme Value Theorem 4. Fermat’s Theorem If \\(f\\) has a local maximum or minimum at \\(c\\), and if \\(f^\\prime(c)\\) exists, then \\(f^\\prime(c) = 0.\\) Examples 5. Definition A critical number of a function \\(f\\) is a number \\(c\\) in the domain of \\(f\\) such that either \\(f^\\prime(c) = 0\\) or \\(f^\\prime(c)\\) does not exist. Example 18 Find the critical numbers of \\(f(x)=x^{3/5}(4-x).\\) In terms of critical numbers, Fermat’s Theorem can be rephrased as, 6. Fermat’s Theorem (modification) If \\(f\\) has a local maximum or minimum at \\(c\\), then \\(c\\) is a critical number of \\(f\\). 7. The closed interval method To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function \\(f\\) on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\): Find the values of \\(f\\) at the critical numbers of \\(f\\) in \\((a,b)\\). Find the values of \\(f\\) at the endpoints of the interval. The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value. Example 19 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function \\(f(x)=x^3-3x^2+1\\) \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\leq x \\leq4.\\) 5.1.9.2 How derivatives affect the shape of a graph 5.1.9.2.1 What does \\(f^\\prime\\) say about \\(f\\)? Increasing/ Decreasing Test If \\(f^\\prime (x) &gt;0\\) on an interval, then \\(f\\) is increasing on that interval If \\(f^\\prime (x) &lt;0\\) on an interval, then \\(f\\) is decreasing on that interval Example 20 Find where the function \\(f(x)=3x^4-4x^3- 12x^2+5\\) is increasing and where it is decreasing The First Derivative Test Suppose that \\(c\\) is a critical number of a continuous function \\(f\\). If \\(f^\\prime\\) changes from positive to negative at \\(c\\), then \\(f\\) has a local maximum at \\(c\\). If \\(f^\\prime\\) changes from negative to positive at \\(c\\), then \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(c\\). If \\(f^\\prime\\) does not change sign at \\(c\\) (for example, if \\(f^\\prime\\) is positive on both sides of \\(c\\) or negative on both sides), then \\(f\\) has no local maximum or minimum at \\(c\\). 5.1.9.2.2 What does \\(f^{\\prime \\prime}\\) say about \\(f\\)? Concavity Definition If the graph of \\(f\\) lies above all of its tangents on an interval \\(I\\), then it is called concave upward on \\(I\\). If the graph of \\(f\\) lies below all of its tangents on \\(I\\), it is called concave downward on \\(I\\). Concavity Test If \\(f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)&gt;0\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\), then the graph of \\(f\\) is concave upward on \\(I\\). If \\(f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)&lt;0\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\), then the graph of \\(f\\) is concave downward on \\(I\\). Definition: Inflection Point A point \\(P\\) in a curve \\(y=f(x)\\) is called an inflection point if \\(f\\) is continuous there and the curve changes from concave upward to concave downward or from concave downward to concave upward at \\(P\\). The Second Derivative Test Suppose \\(f^{\\prime \\prime}\\) is continuous near \\(c\\). (a) If \\(f^\\prime (c) = 0\\) and \\(f^{\\prime \\prime}(c) &gt;0,\\) then \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(c\\) (b) If \\(f^\\prime (c) = 0\\) and \\(f^{\\prime \\prime}(c) &lt;0,\\) then \\(f\\) has a local maximum at \\(c\\) Example 21 Discuss the curve \\(y= x^4 - 4x^3\\) with respect to concavity, points of inflection and local maxima and minima. 5.2 Integration 5.2.1 The Definite Integral Definition: Definite Integral If \\(f\\) is a continuous function defined for \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\), we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) sub-intervals of equal width \\(\\Delta x = (b-a)/n\\). We let \\(x_0 (=a) , x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n(=b)\\) be the endpoints of these sub-intervals and we let \\(x_1^*,x_2^*, \\dots, x_n^*\\) be any sample point in these sub-intervals, so \\(x_i^*\\) lies in the \\(i\\)th sub-interval \\([x_{i-1} , x_i]\\). Then definite integral of \\(f\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) is \\[\\int_a^b f(x) dx = lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) \\Delta x \\] The definite integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) dx\\) is a number and does not depend on \\(x\\). Therefore, any letter can be used in place of \\(x\\) without changing the value of the integral \\[\\int_a^b f(x) dx= \\int_a^b f(t) dt = \\int_a^b f(r) dr\\] A definite integral can be interpreted as a net area. 5.2.1.1 Properties of the Definite Integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) dx= -\\int_b^a f(x) dx\\) \\(\\int_a^a f(x) dx= 0\\) \\(\\int_a^b[ f(x)+ g(x)] dx= \\int_a^b f(x) dx + \\int_a^b g(x)dx\\) \\(\\int_a^b c dx= c(b-a),\\) where \\(c\\) is a constant. \\(\\int_a^b c f(x) dx= c\\int_a^b f(x) dx\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant. \\(\\int_a^b[ f(x)- g(x)] dx= \\int_a^b f(x) dx - \\int_a^b g(x)dx\\) \\(\\int_a^b f(x) dx + \\int_b^c f(x)dx = \\int_a^c f(x) dx\\) 5.2.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus The fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes a connection between the two branches of calculus and integral calculus. \\[g(x) = \\int_a^x f(t) dt,\\] where \\(f\\) is a continuous function on \\([a,b]\\) and \\(x\\) varies between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I If \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([a,b],\\) then the function \\(g\\) defined by \\[g(x) = \\int_a^x f(t) dt,\\text{ } a\\leq x \\leq b\\] is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) and differentiable on \\((a,b),\\) and \\(g^\\prime(x) = f(x).\\) Using Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I as \\[\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_a^x f(t) dt= f(x)\\] when \\(f\\) is continuous. Example 22 Find the derivative of the function \\(g(x) = \\int_0^x \\sqrt{1+ t+ t^2} dt\\) 5.2.3 Indefinite Integrals 5.2.3.1 Antiderivatives Consider the problem of finding a function \\(F\\) whose derivative is a known function \\(f\\). If such a function \\(F\\) exists, it is called an antiderivative of \\(f\\). Definition: Antiderivative A function \\(F\\) is called an antiderivative of \\(f\\) on an interval \\(I\\) if \\(F^\\prime(x) = f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\) Indefinite integral The notation \\(\\int f(x)dx\\) is traditionally used for an antiderivative of \\(f\\) and is called an indefinite integral. Thus \\[\\int f(x) dx = F(x) \\text{ means } F^\\prime(x) = f(x)\\] If \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([a,b],\\) then \\[\\int_a^b f(x)dx = \\left[\\int f(x)dx \\right]_a^b\\] Indefinite Integrals \\(\\int cf(x) dx = c\\int f(x)dx\\) \\(\\int [f(x) +g(x)] dx = \\int f(x)dx + \\int g(x)dx\\) \\(\\int k dx = kx+C\\) \\(\\int x^n dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C\\) \\((n \\neq -1)\\) \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x} dx = ln|x|+C\\) \\(\\int e^xdx= e^x+C\\) \\(\\int a^xdx= \\frac{a^x}{ln \\text{ } a}+C\\) Example 23 Evaluate \\(\\int_1^9 \\frac{2t^2+t^2\\sqrt{t}-1}{t^2} dt\\) 5.2.4 The Substitution Rule The Substitution Rule If \\(u= g(x)\\) is a differentiable function whose range is and interval \\(I\\) and \\(f\\) is continuous on \\(I\\), then \\[\\int f(g(x))g^\\prime(x)dx=\\int f(u)du\\] Example 24 Evaluate \\(\\int\\sqrt{2x+1} dx\\) The Substitution Rule for Definite Integrals If \\(g^\\prime\\) is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) and \\(f\\) is continuous on the range of \\(u=g(x),\\) then \\[\\int_a^bf(g(x))g^\\prime(x)dx=\\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u)du\\] Example 25 Evaluate \\(\\int_0^4\\sqrt{2x+1} dx\\) Integrals of Symmetric Functions Suppose \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([-a,a].\\) If \\(f\\) is even \\([f(-x) = f(x)],\\) then \\(\\int_{-a}^af(x) dx = 2\\int_0^af(x)dx\\) If \\(f\\) is odd \\([f(-x) = - f(x)],\\) then \\(\\int_{-a}^af(x) dx = 0\\) 5.2.5 The integral of the logarithmic and exponential function \\(\\int e^xdx = e^x + C\\) \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x}dx = ln(x) + C\\) if \\(x&gt;0\\) \\(\\int a^xdx = \\frac{a^x}{ln (a)} + C\\) Example 26 Evaluate \\(\\int \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{5} dx\\) Example 27 Evaluate \\(\\int \\frac{3x^2}{x^3+1} dx\\) \\(x\\neq -1\\) 5.2.6 Integration by Parts \\[\\int f(x) g^\\prime(x)dx=f(x)g(x)-\\int g(x)f^\\prime(x)dx\\] Let \\(u = f(x)\\) and \\(v=g(x)\\). Then the differentials are \\(du = f^\\prime (x) dx\\) and \\(dv = g^\\prime(x) dx,\\) so, by the Substitution Rule, the formula for integration by parts becomes \\[\\int udv = uv-\\int vdu\\] Example 28 Evaluate \\(\\int ln \\text{ } x dx\\) Example 29 Evaluate \\(\\int x^2e^x dx\\) \\[\\int_a^b f(x) g^\\prime(x)dx=\\left [ f(x)g(x) \\right ]_a^b-\\int_a^b g(x)f^\\prime(x)dx\\] 5.2.7 Trigonometric Functions Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions \\(\\frac{d}{dx} sin(x) = cos(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx} cos(x) = -sin(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx} tan(x) = sec^2(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx} sec(x) = sec(x)tan(x)\\) Integration of Trigonometric Functions \\(\\int cos(x)dx = sin(x) +C\\) \\(\\int sin(x)dx = -cos(x) +C\\) \\(\\int sec^2(x) = tan(x) +C\\) \\(\\int sec(x)tan(x) = sec(x) +C\\) 5.3 Tutorial Chapter 5.1: Differentiation The graph of function \\(f\\) is given.

Eg: Student, household, farm, company, tomato plant iv Variable A variable is a feature characteristic which has different ‘values’ or categories for different elements (items/subjects/individuals) Eg: Gender of client, brand of mobile phones, risk level, number of emails received per day, age of client, income of client v Data Data are measurements or facts that are collected from a statistical unit/entity of interest We collect data on variables Data are raw numbers or facts that must be processed (analysed) to get useful information. We get information from data. Eg: Variable: Age (in years) of client Data: 21, 45, 18, 32, 30, 22, 23, 27 Information: The mean age is 27.25 years The minimum age is 18 years The range of ages is 18-45 The percentage of clients below 25 years of age: 50% vi Statistic Characteristic of a sample The value which calculated based on sample data vii Parameter Characteristic of a population The value which calculated based on population data viii Census When a researcher gathers data from the whole population for a given measurement, it is called a census ix Sampling When a researcher gathers data from a sample of the population for a given measurement, it is called sampling The process of selecting a sample is also called sampling Why take a sample instead of studying every member of the population ? Prohibitive cost of census Destruction of item being studied may be required Not possible to test or inspect all members of a population being studied. 6.1.2 Branches of Statistics i Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics consists of organizing, summarizing and presenting data in an informative way. The main purpose of descriptive statistics is to provide an overview of the data collected. Descriptive statistics describes the data collected through frequency tables, graphs and summary measures (mean, variance, quartiles, etc.). ii Inferential Statistics In inferential statistics sample data are used to draw inferences (i.e. derive conclusions) or make predictions about the populations from which the sample has been taken. This includes methods used to make decisions, estimates, predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample. This includes point estimations, interval estimation, test of hypotheses, regression analysis, time series analysis, multivariate analysis, etc. 6.1.3 Types of Variables 6.1.3.1 Qualitative / Quantitative Variables i Qualitative variable (Categorical variable) The characteristic is a quality. The data are categories. They cannot be given numerical values. However, it may be given a numerical label Qualitative variables are sometimes referred as categorical variables. Eg: Gender: Age group: Education level: A/L stream: Degree type: Hair colour: FIT student batch: Undergraduate level: Grade that you can obtain for CM 1110/ CM1130 ii Quantitative variable The characteristic is a quantity The data are numbers Quantitative data require numeric values that indicate how much or how many. They are obtained by counting or measuring with some scale Eg: Number of family members: Number of emails received per day: Weight of a student: Age: Credit balance in the SIM card: Time remaining in class: Temperature: Marks 6.1.3.2 Discrete/ Continuous Variables Quantitative variables can be classified as either discrete or continuous. i Discrete Variables Quantitative Usually the data are obtained by counting There are impossible values between any two possible values Eg: Number of family members: Number of emails received per day: ii Continuous Variables Quantitative Usually, the data are obtained by measuring with a scale There are no impossible values between any two possible values.(any value between any two possible values is also a possible value) i.e a continuous variable can take any value within a specified range. Eg: Weight of a student: Age: Credit balance in the SIM card: Time remaining in class: Temperature: Marks 6.1.4 Scales of Measurements There are four levels of measurements called, nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. Each levels has its own rules and restrictions Different levels of measurement contains different amount of information with respect to whatever the data are measuring i Nominal Scale Qualitative No order or ranking in categories. These categories have to be mutually exclusive, i.e. it should not be possible to place an individual or object in more than one category A name of a category can be substituted by a number, but it will be mere label and have no numerical meaning ii Ordinal Scale Qualitative Categories can be ordered or ranked A name of a category can be substituted by a number, but such a sequence does not indicate absolute quantities. Difference between any two numbers on the scale does not have a numerical meaningful. It cannot be assumed that the differences between adjacent numbers on the scale are equal. iii Interval Scale Quantitative Data can be ordered or ranked There is no absolute zero point. Zero is only an arbitrary point with which other values can compare Difference between two numbers is a meaningful numerical value Ration of two numbers is not a meaningful numerical value. iv Ratio Scale Quantitative Highest level of measurement There exist an absolute zero point (It has a true zero point) Ratio between different measurements is meaningful 6.2 Presentation of Data The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew 1 Here’s a quick summary of our variables: Variable Name Description PassengerID Passenger ID (just a row number, so obviously not useful for prediction) Survived Survived (1) or died (0) Pclass Passenger class (first, second or third) Name Passenger name Gender Passenger Gender Age Passenger age SibSp Number of siblings/spouses aboard Parch Number of parents/children aboard Ticket Ticket number Fare Fare Cabin Cabin Embarked Port of embarkation (S = Southampton, C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown) 6.2.1 Tabular Presentations of Data Raw Data Raw data are collected data that have not been organized numerically Eg: Passenger age ## PassengerId Survived Pclass ## 1 1 0 3 ## 2 2 1 1 ## 3 3 1 3 ## 4 4 1 1 ## 5 5 0 3 ## 6 6 0 3 ## Name Sex Age SibSp Parch ## 1 Braund, Mr. Owen Harris male 22 1 0 ## 2 Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer) female 38 1 0 ## 3 Heikkinen, Miss.

Eg: Passenger age ## [1] 2 2 4 8 14 14 14 15 18 19 20 21 22 26 27 28 28 31 34 35 35 35 38 38 39 ## [26] 40 42 54 55 58 66 Frequency Table (Frequency Distributions) A frequency table (frequency distribution) is a listing of the values a variable takes in a data set, along with how often (frequently) each value occurs frequency can be recorded as a frequency or count: the number of times a value occurs, or percentage frequency: the percentage of times a value occurs Percentage frequency can be calculated as, \\[Percentage frequency = \\frac{a}{b} \\times100 \\%\\] The objective of constructing a frequency table are as follows to organize the data in a meaningful manner to determine the nature or shape of the distribution to draw charts and graphs for the presentation of data to facilitate computational procedures for measures of average and spread to make comparisons between different data sets There are two basic types of frequency tables Simple frequency tables (Ungrouped frequency distribution) Grouped frequency distribution 6.2.1.1 Simple frequency table (Ungrouped frequency distribution) Each possible value or category is taken as a class More suitable for Qualitative variables Discrete variables Sometimes construct for continuous variables when there is a small number of possible values between the minimum and maximum. Examples: CASE I: Example 1 The native countries of 56 students from a certain education institute are as follows: ## [1] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;BD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;IN&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;BD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;IN&quot; ## [16] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;BD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; ## [31] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;PK&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;PK&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;PK&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; ## [46] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;MD&quot; BD- Bangladesh, IN-India, MD-Maldives, PK-Pakistan, SL- Sri Lanka Construct a frequency table ## Native Country Count Percentage (%) ## Bangladesh 3 5.357 ## India 2 3.571 ## Maldives 5 8.929 ## Pakistan 3 5.357 ## Sri Lanka 43 76.786 ## Total 56 100.000 CASE II: Example 2 The grades of 30 students for Statistics are as follows: ## [1] &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [20] &quot;D&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; Construct a frequency table ## Grade Count Percentage (%) ## A 5 17.241 ## B 10 34.483 ## C 6 20.690 ## D 5 17.241 ## E 2 6.897 ## F 1 3.448 ## Total 29 100.000 CASE III: Example 3 The number of family members of a sample of undergraduates of Batch 19 are as follows: ## [1] 7 5 3 4 5 4 3 6 4 4 5 2 7 4 5 6 4 4 3 5 Construct a frequency table ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## `Number of family members` Count `Percentage (%)` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2 1 5 ## 2 3 3 15 ## 3 4 7 35 ## 4 5 5 25 ## 5 6 2 10 ## 6 7 2 10 CASE IV: Example 4 The ages (in years) of a sample of undergraduates of Batch 19 are as follows: ## [1] 21 22 22 23 22 24 24 23 21 22 23 22 22 23 21 21 22 23 22 23 Construct a frequency table ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## `Age (years)` Count `Percentage (%)` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 21 4 20 ## 2 22 8 40 ## 3 23 6 30 ## 4 24 2 10 6.2.1.2 Grouped frequency distribution A grouped frequency distribution (table) is obtained by constructing classes (or intervals) for the data and then listing the corresponding number of values in each interval. Suitable for quantitative variables with large number of possible values in the range of data. Note that when items have been grouped in this way, their individual values are lost. When studying about frequency distributions it is very important to know the meaning of the following terms i Class intervals In a frequency distribution the total range of the observations are divided into a number of classes. Those are called class intervals Eg: Class intervals: 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, …, 40-44 ii Class limits Class limits are the smallest and largest piece of data value that can fall into a given class. In the class interval 10-14, the end numbers, 10 and 14, are called class limits The smaller number (10) is the lower class limit The larger number (14) is the upper class limit iii Class boundaries Class boundaries are obtained by adding the upper limit of one class interval to the lower limit of the next-higher class interval and dividing by 2. Class boundaries are also called True class limits Class boundaries should not coincide with actual observations Class interval Class boundaries 10 - 14 9.5 – 14.5 15 - 19 14.5 – 19.5 20 - 24 19.5 – 24.5 25 - 29 24.5 – 29.5 30 - 34 29.5 – 34.5 35 - 39 34.5 – 39.5 40 - 44 39.5 – 44.5 iv The size or width of a class interval The size or width of a class interval is the difference between the lower and upper class boundaries It is also referred to as the class width, class size, or class length Eg: The class width for the class 10-14 is = 14.5-9.5 = 5 v The class mark ( Midpoint of the class) Midpoint of the class Also called as class midpoint \\(\\text{Midpoint of the class} = \\frac{\\text{Lower limit} + \\text{Upper limit}}{2}\\) or \\(\\text{Midpoint of the class} = \\frac{\\text{Lower boundary} + \\text{Upper boundary}}{2}\\) vi Open class intervals A class interval that, at least theoretically, has either no upper class limit or no lower class limit indicated is called an open class interval For example, referring to age groups of individuals, the class interval “65 year and over” is an open class interval Rules and Practices for constructing grouped frequency tables Every data value should be in an interval The intervals should be mutually exclusive The classes of the distribution must be arrayed in size order. The number of classes not less than 5 or not greater than 15 is recommended. The following formula is often used to determine the number of classes: If n is the number of observations, then \\[\\text{Number of classes} = \\sqrt{n}\\] \\[\\text{Width of the class interval} = \\frac{Range}{\\sqrt{n}}= \\frac{Min-Max}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Data should be represented within classes having limits which the data can attain Classes should be continuous By convention, the beginning of the interval is given the appropriate exact value, rather than the end. Eg: intervals of 0-49, 50-99,100-149 would be preferred over the intervals 1-50, 51-100, 101-150 etc. The number f observations falling into each category or class interval (class frequency) can be easily found using tally marks. Examples: In a grouped frequency distribution, class intervals can be constructed in different ways Example 1 Class interval Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Example 2 Salary Number of employees 0 – 1999 1 2000 – 3999 31 4000 – 5999 18 6000 – 7999 4 8000 – 9999 2 10000 - 11999 1 12000 – 13999 0 14000 – 15999 0 16000 – 17999 1 18000 -19999 1 20000-21999 1 Salary Number of employees 0 – 1999 1 2000 – 3999 31 4000 – 5999 18 6000 – 7999 4 8000 – 9999 2 10000 - 15999 1 16000 – 21999 3 Total 60 Example 3 Salary Number of employees Less than 2000 1 2000 – 2999 11 3000 – 3999 20 4000 – 5999 18 6000 – 9999 6 Greater than or equal to 10000 4 Total 60 6.2.1.3 Two-way frequency table Cross tabulation, Cross classification table, Contingency table, Two-way table Display the relationship between two or more qualitative variables (categorical variables (nominal or ordinal)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## Survived First Second Third ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 died 80 97 372 ## 2 Survived 136 87 119 ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## Survived First Second Third ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 died 0.37 0.53 0.76 ## 2 Survived 0.63 0.47 0.24 6.2.2 Graphic Presentations of Data A diagram is a visual form for presentation of statistical data. The form of the diagram varies according to the nature of the data 6.2.2.1 Describing Qualitative Data Bar chart / Pie chart Suitable for Qualitative variables (nominal or ordinal) Discrete variables (when the number of bars or number of different values is small) I Bar Chart A bar graph uses bars to represent discrete categories of data It can be drawn either on horizontal (more common) or vertical base A rectangle of equal width is drawn for each category The height (in vertical bar chart) or the length (in horizontal bar chart) of the rectangle is equal to the category’s frequency or percentage. i Simple Bar Chart Only one categorical variable can be presented Often used in conjunction with simple frequency tables The bars do not touch each other The gaps between adjacent bars are same in length Passenger class Count Percentage First 216 24.242 Second 184 20.651 Third 491 55.107 ii Component Bar Chart Sub divided bar chart/ Stacked bar chart Use to compare two or more qualitative variables (nominal or ordinal) Often used in conjunction with two way tables Start by drawing a simple bar chart with the total figures. The bars are then divided into the component parts Can be drawn on absolute figures or percentages The various components should be kept in the same order in each bar To distinguish different components from one another, different colours or shades can be used Survived First Second Third died 80 97 372 Survived 136 87 119 Percentage component bar chart When sub-divided bar chart is drawn on percentage basis it is called percentage bar chart The various components are expressed as percentage to the total All bars are equal in height Survived First Second Third died 0.3703704 0.5271739 0.7576375 Survived 0.6296296 0.4728261 0.2423625 iii Multiple Bar Chart Compound bar chart/ Cluster bar chart Use to compare two or more qualitative variables (nominal or ordinal) Often used in conjunction with two way tables These bar charts are drawn side by side Survived First Second Third died 37.04 52.72 75.76 Survived 62.96 47.28 24.24 6.2.2.2 Describing Quantitative Data Histogram/ Dot plot / Box plot/ Scatter plot II Histogram Histogram looks similar to bar chart since it also has bars. However, it is different from a bar chart in a number of aspects. One main difference is that in the histogram, the bars are drawn attached to each other; there are no gaps between bars like in a bar chart. Histogram is used to show the shape of the distribution of a continuous variable. However, the histogram is also used for discrete variables when the data are grouped in to class intervals. In a histogram, the area of a bar should be proportional to the frequency of the corresponding class. If all the bars have the same width, then the height of a bar can represent the frequency. The bar corresponding to a class interval should be drawn from the lower class boundary to the upper class boundary. In this way there will be no gaps between the bars. Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a histogram for the data Marks Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Total 40 Example 2 III Frequency polygon If the mid-point of the top of each block in a histogram is joined by a straight line, a frequency polygon is produced. This is done under the assumption that the frequencies in a class-interval are evenly distributed throughout the class Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a frequency polygon for the data Marks Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Total 40 IV Frequency curve A frequency curve is drawn by smoothing the frequency polygon. It is smooth in such a way that the sharp turns are avoided Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a frequency curve for the data Marks Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Total 40 frequency curves arising in practice take on certain characteristics shapes as shown bellow The symmetrical or bell shaped frequency curves are characterized by the fact that observations equidistant from the central maximum have the same frequency. An important example is the normal curve. In the moderately asymmetrical or skewed frequency curves the tail of the curve to one side of the central maximum is longer than that to the other. If the longer tail occurs to the right the curve is said to be skewed to the right or to have positive skewness.While if the reverse is true the curve is said to be skewed to the left or to have negative skewness. In a J shaped or reverse J shaped curve a maximum occurs at one end. A U shaped frequency curve has maxima at both ends. A bimodal frequency curve has two maxima. These appear as two distinct peaks (local maxima) in the frequency curve.When the two modes are unequal the larger mode is known as the major mode and the other as the minor mode. A multimodal frequency curve has more than two maxima. V Dot Plot A dot plot is a method of presenting data which gives a rough but rapid visual appreciation of the way in which the data are distributed It consists of a horizontal line marked out with divisions of the scale on which the variable is being measured -This graph can be used to represent only the numerical data. VI Box plot (Box and whisker plot) Box plot is also a useful method of representing the behavior of a data set or comparing two or more data sets. Box plot is constructed by identifying five statistics from the data set as largest value, smallest values, median, Q1 and Q3. Example: Construct a box plot for the following data set (Marks of students) \\[\\text{52, 88, 56, 79, 72, 91, 85, 88, 68, 63, 76, 73, 86, 95, 12, 69}\\] Xmin = 12 Xmax = 95 Q1 =64.25 Q2 = Median = 74.5 Q3 = 87.5 VII Violin plot A violin plot is a method of plotting quantitative data. It is similar to a box plot, with the addition of a rotated kernel density plot on each side. Violin plots are similar to box plots, except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values, usually smoothed by a kernel density estimator. 6.3 Summary Measures Although frequency distribution serves useful purpose, there are many situations that require other types of data summarization. What we need in many instances is the ability to summarize the data by means of a single number called a descriptive measure. Descriptive measures may be computed from the data of a sample or the data of a population. To distinguish between them we have the following definitions. Definitions A descriptive measure computed from the data of a sample is called a statistic. A descriptive measure computed from the data of a population is called a parameter. 6.3.1 Measures of Central Tendency Measure of central tendency yield information about the center, or middle part, of a group of numbers. Eg: Mode, Median, Arithmetic Mean, Geometric mean, Harmonic Mean, Quadratic Mean, Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles 6.3.1.1 Mode The Mode is the most frequently occuring value in a set of data Organizing the data into an ordered array (an ordering of the numbers from smallest to largest) helps to locate the mode. A series having only one mode is called as uni-modal In the case of a tie for the most frequent occuring value, two modes are listed. Then the data are set to be bimodal If a set of data is not exactly bimodal but contains two values that are more dominant than others, some researchers take the liberty of referring to the data set as bimodal even without an exact tie for the mode. Data sets with more than two modes are referred to as multimodal. The mode is an appropriate measure of central tendency for nominal-level data. The mode can be used to determine which category occurs most frequently. For ungrouped data Example 01: Find mode of the following datasets Dataset 1: 12, 14, 10, 8, 6, 8, 15, 8 Dataset 2: 40, 44, 57, 48, 78 Dataset 3: 42, 45, 55, 50, 45, 40, 55, 45, 52, 55, 54 For grouped frequency data Example 02: Find mode of the following data Marks Number of students 20 8 30 10 40 16 50 8 60 5 70 3 Advantages and disadvantages of mode Advantages Easy to understand Easy to calculate Not affected by extreme values in the dataset Good for qualitative data Disadvantages Not suitable for further mathematical calculations There may be more than one mode for a given dataset It is not based upon all the observations In some cases, we may not be able to find a mode for a given dataset 6.3.1.2 Median The median is the middle value in an ordered array of numbers. Median divides the series into equal parts The following steps are used to determine the median. STEP 1: Arrange the observations in an ordered data array. STEP 2: For an odd number of terms, find the middle term of the ordered array. It is the median. STEP 3: For an even number of terms, find the arithmetic mean of the middle two terms. This arithmetic mean is the median. \\[Median = \\text{the }(\\frac{n+1}{2})\\text{th item in the data array} \\] The level of data measurement must be at least ordinal for a median to be meaningful. Example 1: Find the median of the dataset 1, 8, 6, 3, 2 Example 2: Find the median of the dataset 8, 9, 1, 2, 14, 12 Advantages and disadvantages of median Advantages Simple to understand Easy to calculate Not affected by extreme values in the dataset Can be calculated even for qualitative variables (ordinal scale data) Disadvantages It is not based upon all the observations 6.3.1.3 Arithmetic Mean The arithmetic mean (usually called mean) is the sum of all observations divided by the total number of observations. Population Mean The poupulation mean us represented by the Greek letter \\(mu\\) (\\(\\mu\\)). Let, \\(N\\) is the number of terms in the population. \\[\\mu = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{N}=\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_N}{N}\\] Sample Mean The sample mean is represented by \\(\\bar{x}\\) Let, \\(n\\) is the number of terms in the sample \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{n}=\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_n}{n}\\] It is inappropriate to use the mean to analyse data that are not at least interval level in measurement. Example 1: Calculate the mean from the following data Student 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Marks 40 50 53 78 58 60 73 35 43 48 Advantages and disadvantages of arithmetic mean Advantages Simple to understand Easy to calculate Based on all the observations Well defined Unique Can be used in further calculation Disadvantages Can be affected by extreme values in the dataset May lead to false conclusions Only applicable to quantitative data (not applicable to qualitative data) Empirical relationship between mean, mode, median In case of symmetrical distribution, mean, median and mode coincide \\((mean = meadian= mode)\\) For a moderately asymmetrical distribution, the following relationship exists \\(Mean – Mode = 3(Mean - Median)\\) Choice between mean and median Mean is very sensitive to outliers.Median is not sensitive to outliers When there are outliers in a data set, median is more appropriate than mean 6.3.1.4 Quartiles, Deciles and Percentiles Median divides the data set into two equal parts. There are other values which divide the data set into a number of equal parts Those are Quartiles, Deciles and Percentiles (a) Quartiles (Q) – Quartiles divide an array into four equal parts \\[Q_i = \\text{the }\\frac{i}{4}(n+1)\\text{th item in the data array} \\] (b) Deciles (D) – Deciles divide an array into ten equal parts \\[D_i = \\text{the }\\frac{i}{10}(n+1)\\text{th item in the data array} \\] (c) Percentiles (P) – Percentiles divide an array into 100 equal parts \\[P_i = \\text{the }\\frac{i}{100}(n+1)\\text{th item in the data array} \\] 6.3.2 Measures of Variability Measure of central tendency yield information about particular points of a data set. However, business researchers can use another group of analytic tools to describe a set of data. These tools are measures of variability, which describe the spread or the dispersion of a set of data. Using measures of variability in conjunction with measures of central tendency makes possible a more complete numerical description of the data. This section focuses on seven measures of variability for ungrouped data: range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, z score and coefficient of variation. 6.3.2.1 Range The range is the difference between the largest value of a data set and the smallest value. \\[Range = Maximum - Minimum\\] One important use of the range is in quality assurance, where the range is used to construct control charts Advantages and disadvantages of range Advantages Easy to understand and calculate Disadvantages Consider only the highest and lowest values of the data and fails to take account of any other observations in the dataset Heavily influenced by extreme values 6.3.2.2 Interquartile Range (IQR) We use the interquartile range (IQR) to measure the spread of a data around the median (M). The interquartile range is the range of values between the first and third quartile. Essentially it is the range of the middle 50% of the data and is determined by computing the value of \\(Q_3 - Q_1\\). The interquartile range is especially useful in situations where data users are more interested in values towards the middle and less interested in extremes. The interquartile range is used in the construction of box and whisker plots. By eliminating the lowest 25% and the highest 25% of the items in a series, we are left with the central 50% , which are ordinarily free of extreme values. Advantages Easy to understand and calculate Not influenced by extreme values Disadvantages Ignore the first \\(25\\%\\) and the last \\(25\\%\\) in the dataset 6.3.2.3 Variance and Standard Deviation To measure the spread of data around the mean, we use the standard deviation (S). The variance and standard deviation are two very popular measures of dispersion. These measures are not meaningful unless the data are at least interval-level data. Their formulations are categorized into whether to evaluate from a population or from a sample. NOTE Sum of deviations from the arithmetic mean is always zero. \\[{\\sum{(x-\\mu)} = 0}\\] This property requires considering the alternative ways to obtain measure of variability. 6.3.2.3.1 Variance The variance is the average of the squared deviations about the mean for a set of numbers. The population variance is denoted by \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x-\\mu)^2}{N}\\] The sum of the squared deviations about the mean of a set of values - called the sum of squares of \\(x\\) and sometimes abbreviated as \\(SS_x\\) Because the variance is computed from squared deviations, the final result is expressed in terms of squared units of measurements. Statistics measured in squared units are problematic to interpret. 6.3.2.3.2 Standard Deviation The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The population standard deviation is denoted by \\(\\sigma\\) \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x-\\mu)^2}{N}}=\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\] One feature of standard deviation that distinguishes it from a variance is that the standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the raw data, whereas the variance is expressed in those units squared. Advantages Based on all the observations Since this is based on arithmetic mean, it has all the merits of it The most important and widely used measure of dispersion Disadvantages Not easy to understand and difficult to calculate Gives more weight to extreme values, because the values are squared up 6.3.2.4 Empirical Rule The empirical rule is an important rule of thumb that is used to state the approximate percentage of values that lie within a given number of standard deviations from the mean of a set of data if the data are normally distributed The empirical rule is used only for three numbers of standard deviations: \\(1\\sigma\\), \\(2\\sigma\\), \\(3\\sigma\\) Distance from the mean Values within distance \\(\\mu\\pm1\\sigma\\) \\(68\\%\\) \\(\\mu\\pm2\\sigma\\) \\(95\\%\\) \\(\\mu\\pm3\\sigma\\) \\(99.7\\%\\) If a set of data is normally distributed, or bell shaped, approximately \\(68\\%\\) of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean, \\(95\\%\\) are within two standard deviations, and almost \\(100\\%\\) are within three standard deviations. 6.3.2.5 Population versus sample variance and standard deviations The sample variance is denoted by \\(s^2\\) and the sample standard deviation by \\(s\\). The main use for sample variances and standard deviations is as estimators of population variances and standard deviations. Thus, computation of the sample variance and standard deviation differs slightly from computation of the population variance and standard deviation. Both the sample variance and sample standard deviation use \\(n-1\\)int he denominator instead of \\(n\\) because using \\(n\\) in the denominator of a sample variance results in a statistic that tends to underestimate the population variance. While discussion of the properties of good estimator is beyond the scope of this course, one of the properties of a good estimator is being unbiased. Whereas, using \\(n\\) in the denominator of the sample variance makes it a biased estimator, using \\(n-1\\) allows it to be an unbiased estimator, which is a desirable property in inferential statistics. Sample variance \\[s^2 = \\frac{\\sum{(x-\\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}\\] Sample standard deviation \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(x-\\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}= \\sqrt{s^2}\\] 6.3.2.6 Computational formulas for variance and standard deviation An alternative method of computing variance and standard deviation, sometimes referred to as the computational method or shortcut method, is available. Algebraically, \\[\\sum{(x-\\mu)^2}= \\sum{x^2}- \\frac{(\\sum x)^2}{N}\\] and \\[\\sum{(x-\\bar{x})^2}= \\sum{x^2}- \\frac{(\\sum x)^2}{n}\\] Substituting these equivalent expressions into the original formulas for variance and standard deviation yields the following computational formulas. Computational formula for population variance and standard deviation \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum{x^2}- \\frac{(\\sum x)^2}{N}}{N}\\] \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\] Computational formula for sample variance and standard deviation \\[s^2 = \\frac{\\sum{x^2}- \\frac{(\\sum x)^2}{n}}{n-1}\\] \\[s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\] For situations in which the mean is already computed or is given, alternative forms of these formulas are: \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum{x^2}-N\\mu^2}{N}\\] \\[s^2 = \\frac{\\sum{x^2}-n(\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\\] 6.3.2.7 Coefficient of variation In general, for two variables measured with he same units (eg: two groups of people both weighed in kg), the group with the larger variance and standard deviation has n=more variability among their scores. The unit of measure affects the size od the variance. The same population weights, expressed in ‘grams’ rather than kg would have a larger variance and standard deviation. The coefficient of variation, a measure of relative variability gets around this difficulty and makes it possible to compare variability across variables measured in different units. The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage and is denoted CV. \\[CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}(100)\\] Using median and quartile deviation \\[CV = \\frac{\\frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}}{Median}(100)\\] The coefficient of variation essentially is a relative comparison of a standard deviation to its mean. The coefficient of variation can be useful in comparing standard deviations that have been computed from data with different means. The choice of whether to use a coefficient of variation or raw standard deviations to compare multiple standard deviations is a matter of preference The coefficient of variation also provides and optional method of interpreting the value of a standard deviation. 6.3.3 Measures of Shape Measures of shape are tools that can be used to describe the shape of a distribution of data. In this section, we examine two measures of shapes: skewness and Kurtosis. 6.3.3.1 Skewness A distribution of data in which the right half is a mirror image of the left half is said to be symmetrical. One example of a symmetrical distribution is the normal distribution, or bell curve. Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry The measures of asymmetry are called as measures of skewness. The skewed portion is the long, thin part of the curve Skewness and the relationship of the mean, median and mode The concept of skewness helps us to understand the relationship between the mean, median and mode. In a unimodal distribution (distribution with a single peak or mode) that is skewed, the mode is the apex (high point) of the curve and the median is the middle value. The mean tends to be located toward the tail of the distribution, because the mean is affected by all values, including the extreme ones. A bell-shaped or normal distribution with the mean, median and mode all at the centre of the distribution has no skewness. Figure 6.1: Relationship of mean, median and mode for different types of skewness 6.3.3.1.1 Pearsonian coefficient of skewness This coefficient compares the mean and median in light of the magnitude of the standard deviation \\[S_k = \\frac{3(\\mu-M_d)}{\\sigma}\\] where \\(S_k\\) = coefficient of skewness, \\(M_d\\) = median Note that if the distribution is symmetrical, the mean and median are the same value and hence the coefficient of skewness is equal to zero. If the value of \\(S_k\\) is positive, the distribution is positively skewed. If the value of \\(S_k\\) is negative, the distribution is negatively skewed. The greater the magnitude of \\(S_k\\), the more skewed is the distribution. 6.3.3.2 Kurtosis Kurtosis describes the amount of peakedness of a distribution. Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are peaked or flat relative to a normal distribution Distributions that are high and thin are referred to as leptokurtic distributions. Distributions that are flat and spread out are referred to as platykurtic distributions. Between the above two types are distributions that are more ‘normal’ in shape, referred to as mesokurtic distributions Figure 6.2: Types of kurtosis 6.3.4 Measures of Association Many times in business it is important to explore the relationship between two numerical variables Measures of association are statistics that yeild information about the relatedness of numerical variables. In this section, we discuss only one measure of association, correlation, and do so only for two numerical variables. 6.3.4.1 Scatter plot A scatter plot is a two dimensional graph of pairs of points from two numerical variables In a quantitative bi-variate dataset, we have a \\((x,y)\\) pair for each sampling unit, where \\(x\\) denotes the independent variable and \\(y\\) denotes the dependent variable. Each \\((x,y)\\) pair can be considered as a point on the Cartesian plan. Scatter plot is a plot of all the \\((x,y)\\) pairs in the dataset. The purpose of scatter plot is to illustrate any relationship between two quantitative variables. If the variables are related, what kind of relationship it is, linear or nonlinear? If the relationship is linear, the scatter plot will show whether it is negative or positive. Example: Edgar Anderson’s Iris Data This famous (Fisher’s or Anderson’s) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. 6.3.4.2 Correlation Correlation is a measure of the degree of relatedness of two or more variables. Several measures of correlation are available , the selection of which depends mostly on the level of data being analysed. Ideally, researchers would like to calculate \\(\\rho\\), the population coefficient of correlation. However, because researchers virtually always deal with sample data, this section introduces a widely used sample coefficient of correlation, \\(r\\). This measure is applicable only if both variables being analysed have at least an interval level of data Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)) The statistic \\(r\\) is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, named after Karl Pearson (1857 - 1936). The tern \\(r\\) is a measure of the linear correlation of two variables. It is a number that ranges from -1 to 0 to +1, representing th strength of the linear relationship between the variables. An \\(r\\) value of \\(+1\\) denotes a perfect linear positive relationship between two variables. An \\(r\\) value of \\(-1\\) denotes a perfect linear negative relationship between two variables, which indicates an inverse relationship between two variables: as one variable gets larger, the other gets smaller. An \\(r\\) value of 0 means no linear relationship is present between the two variables. \\[ r = \\frac{\\sum(x-\\bar{x})(y-\\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x-\\bar{x})^2\\sum(y-\\bar{y})^2}}\\] \\[ r = \\frac{\\sum{xy} - \\frac{(\\sum x\\sum y)}{n}}{\\sqrt{[\\sum{x^2- \\frac{(\\sum{x})^2}{n}}][\\sum y^2-\\frac{(\\sum y)^2}{n}]}}\\] Examples: Following figure shows five different degrees of correlation: NOTE When \\(r=0\\), it signifies there is no linear relationship between the two variables. (There can be a non-linear relationship, Figure (e)) Figure (e): There is a very strong curvilinear relationship. But there is no linear relationship. 6.4 Tutorial Chapter 6: Descriptive Statistics A power company in Sri Lanka designs and manufactures power distribution switchboards for hospitals, bridges, airports, highways and water treatment plants.

He developed a questionnaire that yields a satisfaction score between 0 and 100 for participant responses.

Which lottery gives me the highest chance of winning? What are odds of our cricket team winning the next world cup? What is the chance of getting an A+ for CM1110? In order to make decisions or take actions, we need to quantify the possibility of occurrence of an event. For this, we use the term probability. Probability is a quantitative measure of uncertainty, a number that conveys the strength of our belief in the occurrence of an uncertain event. The likelihood of an outcome is quantified by assigning a number from the interval [0, 1] to the outcome (or a percentage from 0 to 100%). Higher numbers indicate that the outcome is more likely than lower numbers. A probability of 0 indicates an outcome will not occur. A probability of 1 indicates that an outcome will occur with certainty. 7.2 Sample Spaces and Events 7.2.1 Random Experiments Statisticians use the word experiment to describe any process that generates a set of data. An experiment usually involves observing or counting or measuring. For example; we might classify items coming off an assembly line as defective or non-defective we may record the number of accidents that occur monthly at the Katubedda junction, hoping to justify the installation of a traffic light; or we may be interested in the volume of gas released in a chemical reaction when the concentration of an acid is varied. An experiment that is repeatable in an identical fashion is called a random experiment or a probability experiment. Random experiment is an activity that leads to the occurrence of one of several possible outcomes which is not likely to be known until its completion, that is, the outcome is not perfectly predictable. This process has the properties that, All possible outcomes can be specified in advance. It can be repeated in an identical manner. The same outcome may not occur on various repetitions so that the actual outcome is not known in advance. Examples Tossing a coin. Throwing a die (or several dice) Drawing cards from a pack Launching of missile and observing its velocity at specified times. 7.2.2 Outcomes The result of a single experiment is called an outcome. It can be instrument reading, counts, “yes” or “no” answers, values obtained through extensive calculations etc. To model and analyze a random experiment, we must understand the set of possible outcomes from the experiment. 7.2.3 Sample space The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space of the experiment. We denote the sample space by \\(\\Omega\\). Each outcome in a sample space is called an element of the sample space or simply a sample point. Activity 01 Write down the corresponding sample space of the following experiments? Example 01: A player rolls a die. Example 02: A player rolls two dice. Example 03: A quality control engineer of a certain company takes a random sample of 4 products as the products come off its production line and counts the number of defective products in the sample. Example 04: A quality control engineer of a certain company takes a random sample of 4 products as products come off its production line and determines whether each product is defective or non-defective Example 05: A company produces a certain type of car batteries. If a battery has a voltage that is outside certain limits, that battery is characterized as bad (B); if the battery has a voltage within the prescribed limits it is characterized as good (G). A quality inspector selects batteries one by one as they come off the production line and tests them until he gets a bad battery. He uses this data to estimate the proportion of bad batteries produced by the company. Example 06: An experiment consists of measuring the lifetime of a bulb. A sample space is often defined based on the objectives of the analysis. The following example illustrates several alternatives Example: Consider an experiment that selects a digital camera and records the recycle time of a flash (the time taken to ready the camera for another flash). The possible values for recycle time can vary according to the resolution of the timer and on the minimum and maximum recycle times. However, since the time is positive we can define the sample space as simply the positive real line Case I Case II If it is known that all recycle times are between 1.0 and 5.5 seconds, the sample space can be written as Case III If the objective of the analysis is to consider only whether the recycle time is low, medium or high, the sample space can be written as a set of three outcomes Case IV If the objective is only to evaluate whether or not a particular camera confirms to a minimum recycle time specification, the sample space can be written as a set of two outcomes The number of outcomes in the sample space can be finite or infinite. Infinite sample spaces can be countable or uncountable. A sample space is countable if the outcomes can be associated with the integers \\(1, 2,3,\\dots\\). If the sample space contains a finite number of elements or an infinite though countable number of elements, it is said to be discrete. The outcomes of some experiments are neither finite nor countably infinite, it is said to be continuous. In the above Example, the choice \\(\\Omega = \\{x | x \\geq 0\\}\\) is an example of a continuous sample space, \\(\\Omega = \\{yes, no\\}\\) is a discrete sample space. As mentioned, the best choice of a sample space depends on the objectives of the study. 7.2.4 Events as subsets of sample spaces An event is a subset of the sample space of a random experiment Events are usually denoted by capital English letters A, B, C, D, E etc. An event containing only one outcome is called a simple event. An event containing more than one outcome is called a compound event. Activity 02 Express the following events as subsets of the sample spaces. Decide whether each event is simple or compound. (No need to calculate probabilities yet.) Example 07: A player rolls a die. A = the event of getting 3 B = the event of getting an even number C = the event of getting a number less than 4 D = the event of getting 2 or 5 Example 08: A player rolls two dice. A = The event that one number is even. B = The event that sum of the two numbers is odd C = The event that the numbers are equal D = The event of getting 2 and 5 E = The event of getting 2 or 5 Example 09: Consider Example 03 in Activity 01, E = the event that sample contains more than 2 defective products. F = the event that the sample contains only two defective products. Example 10: Consider Example 04 in Activity 01 G = the event that sample contains more than 2 defective products. H = the event that the sample contains two defective products. Example 11: Consider Example 05 in Activity 01, I = the event that number of good batteries before a bad battery is 3. J = the event that the number of good batteries before a bad battery is less than 3. Example 12: Consider Example 06 in Activity 01, A = the event that bulb burns for at least 25 hours but burns out before 50 hours. 7.3 Event Operations We can describe new events from combinations of existing events. Because events are subsets, we can use basic set operations to form other events of interest. Some of the basic set operations are summarized here in terms of events: Venn diagrams Diagrams are often used to portray relationships between sets, and these diagrams are also used to describe relationships between events. We can use Venn diagrams to represent a sample space and events in a sample space. 7.3.1 Union Let A and B be two events. The set of outcomes that belong to either only A or only B or to both A and B, is called the union of the two events. It is denoted by \\(A \\cup B\\). \\[A \\cup B = \\{\\omega\\in \\Omega: \\omega \\in A \\text{ or } \\omega\\in B\\}\\] Shaded set in the Venn diagram represents the event \\(A \\cup B\\) 7.3.2 Intersection Let A and B be two sets. The set of outcomes that belong to sets A and B both is called the intersection of the two events. It is denoted by \\(A \\cap B\\). \\[A \\cap B = \\{\\omega\\in \\Omega: \\omega \\in A \\text{ and } \\omega\\in B\\}\\] Shaded set in the Venn diagram represents the event \\(A \\cap B\\) 7.3.2.1 Mutually exclusive events If the events A and B cannot occur together, in other words if \\(A \\cap B\\) cannot occur, then the events A and B are said to be disjoint or mutually exclusive. If A and B are mutually exclusive, then we denote the intersection as \\[A \\cap B = \\{\\} \\text { or } A \\cap B = \\phi.\\] 7.3.3 Complement The set of outcomes that are in sample space \\((\\Omega)\\) but not in A is called the compliment of A. It is denoted by \\(A^\\prime\\) or \\(A^c\\) or \\(\\bar{A}\\) \\[A^\\prime = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: \\omega \\notin A\\}.\\] 7.4 Tutorial Chapter 7: Sets and Relations Which of these sets are equal? \\(\\{r,t,s\\}\\) \\(\\{s,t,r,s\\}\\) \\(\\{t,s,t,r\\}\\) \\(\\{s,r,s,t\\}\\)) Only b and d are equal Only b,c and d are equal They are all equal None of them are equal Let \\(A=\\{1,3,5\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{2,4,6\\}\\) Then \\(A\\cap B = 0\\) \\(A\\cap B = \\phi\\) \\(A\\cap B = \\{\\}\\) \\(A\\cap B = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\)) Only d is correct Only b is correct Only b and c are correct Only a, b and c are correct Find the elements of the set \\(A=\\{\\{1,2,3\\}, \\{4,5\\}, \\{6,7,8\\}\\}\\) and determine whether each of the following is true or false Statement True False a. \\(1\\in A\\) b. \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\subseteq A\\) c. \\(\\{6,7,8\\}\\in A\\) d. \\(\\{\\{4,5\\}\\}\\subseteq A\\) e. \\(\\phi\\in A\\) f. \\(\\phi\\subseteq A\\) g. \\((4,5)\\in A\\) A player rolls a die. What is the sample space of this experiment? Write down the following events as subsets of the sample space. Decide whether each event is simple or compound.

If a battery has a voltage that is outside certain limits, that battery is characterized as bad (B); if the battery has a voltage within the prescribed limits it is characterized as good (G). A quality inspector selects batteries one by one as they come off the production line and tests them until he gets a bad battery. He uses this data to estimate the proportion of bad batteries produced by the company. What is the sample space of this experiment Write down the following events as subsets of the sample space. Decide whether each event is simple or compound. I = the event that number of good batteries before a bad battery is 3. J = the event that the number of good batteries before a bad battery is less than 3. A doctor observes the lifetime of leukemia patients after being treated with a newly developed treatment. What is the sample space of this experiment? Write down the following event as subsets of the sample space. Decide whether it is simple or compound.

Let P1 = the event that the first student pass P2 = the event that the second student pass P3 = the event that the third student pass Write the following events using the above events. The event that all three students pass The event that all three students fails The event that only 2 of the three students pass after the treatments Identify the events of interest as subsets of the sample space. A box contains one ticket with number 1 on it, 2 tickets with number 2, 3 tickets with number 3, 4 tickets with number 4, 5 tickets with number 5, and 6 tickets with number 6. A ticket is taken randomly from the box A = The event of getting an even number? B = The event of getting a number less than 5? C = The event of getting an even number less than 5? Express C in terms of A and B using event operations ) D = The event of getting an even number or a number less than 5? Express D in terms of A and B using event operations Express, E= the event of getting an odd number, using the above defined event or events Three components are connected to form a system as shown in figure (a). Because the components in the 2-3 subsystem are connected in parallel, that subsystem will function if at least one of the two individual components functions. For the entire system to function, component 1 must function and so must be 2-3 subsystem. Each component is either in working condition (s) or not working condition (f) at any time. Let \\(W1 =\\) The event that component 1 is in working condition \\(W2 =\\) The event that component 2 is in working condition \\(W3 =\\) The event that component 3 is in working condition \\(W =\\) The event that the system is in working condition Write the above events as subsets of the sample space.

These methods are referred to as counting techniques. 8.1.1 Basic Counting Principles Sum Rule Principle Product Rule Principle / Multiplication Rule Principle 8.1.1.1 Sum Rule Principle Example 1: Suppose there are 8 male professors (say A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H) and 5 female professors (say J, K, L, M, N) teaching a language class. How many ways are there, a student can choose a language professor? Example 2: Suppose there are 3 different mystery novels, 5 different romance novels, and 4 different adventure novels on a bookshelf. How many different ways are there to choose one of the novels? Sum Rule Principle: Suppose an event \\(E_1\\) can occur in \\(n_1\\) ways, a second event \\(E_2\\) can occur in \\(n_2\\) ways, a third event \\(E_3\\) can occur in \\(n_3\\) ways and so on, and suppose no two of the events can occur simultaneously (at the same time). Then one of the events can occur in \\(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + \\dots\\) ways This principle can be stated in terms of sets as follows, Sum Rule Principle: Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive events (disjoint events). Then: \\[n(A \\cup B) = n(A) + n(B)\\] 8.1.1.2 Product Rule Principle / Multiplication Rule Example 3: The design for a Website is to consist of four colors, three fonts, and three positions for an image. Draw a tree diagram for the different types of designs. - How many different designs are possible? The above tree diagram describes the sample space of all possible designs. The size of the sample space equals the number of branches in the last level of the tree, and this quantity equals \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 36\\). - This leads to the following useful result. Product Rule Principle / Multiplication Rule: Assume an operation can be described as a sequence of k steps, and - the number of ways of completing step 1 is \\(n_1\\), and - the number of ways of completing step 2 is \\(n_2\\) for each way of completing step 1, and - the number of ways of completing step 3 is \\(n_3\\) for each way of completing step 2, and so forth. The total number of ways of completing the operation is \\(n_1\\times n_2 \\times \\dots \\times n_k\\) Example 4: Suppose a password consists of 4 characters, the first 2 being simple letters in the English alphabet and the last 2 being digits. Find the number of Passwords Passwords beginning with a vowel Example 5: There are 5 bus lines from city A to city B, 2 bus lines from city B to city C and 3 bus lines from city C to city D. Find the number of ways a person can travel by bus from city A to city D. Example 6: There are five gates in a school. No student leaves the school from the gate he entered. Find the number of ways a student can enter and leave the school 8.1.2 Factorial Notation The product of the positive integers from 1 to n inclusive occurs very often in mathematics and hence it is denoted by the special symbol \\(n!\\), read “n factorial”. That is \\[n! = 1\\times2\\times3\\times \\dots \\times(n-2)\\times(n-1)\\times n = n\\times (n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times\\dots \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\] NOTE \\[0! = 1\\] \\[1! = 1\\] Examples 7: (a) \\(2!=\\) (b) \\(4!=\\) (c) \\(\\frac{8!}{6!}\\) (d) Represent \\(\\frac{12.11.10}{3.2.1}\\) in terms of factorial notation. 8.1.3 Permutations Permutation is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects. Here the order is important 8.1.3.1 Case I: Permutations of n distinct objects (taken all at a time) Example 8: Find the number of “three-letter words (not necessary to have a meaning)” that can be formed using the letters of the word “TWO”, without repetitions. Using multiplication rule: Permutations of n distinct objects (taken all at time): The number of permutations of n different elements is \\(n!\\) where \\[n! = n \\times (n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times \\dots \\times 2 \\times1\\] NOTE This result follows from the multiplication rule. - A permutation can be constructed by selecting the element to be placed in the first position of the sequence from the n elements, then selecting the element for the second position from the remaining \\((n-1)\\) elements, then selecting the element for the third position from the remaining \\((n-2)\\) elements, and so forth. Example 9: Find the number of ways that 4 people can sit in a row of 4 seats 8.1.3.2 Case II: Permutations of similar objects (taken all at a time) Example 10: Find the number of “three-letter words (not necessary to have a meaning)” that can be formed using the letters of the word “TOO”. Permutations of Similar Objects (taken all at a time): The number of permutations of n \\((=n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + \\dots + n_k)\\) objects in which \\(n_1\\) are alike, \\(n_2\\) are alike, \\(\\dots\\), \\(n_k\\) are alike, is \\[\\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\dots n_k!}\\] Example 11: Find the number of “ten-letter words (not necessary to have a meaning)” that can be formed using the letters of the word “STATISTICS”. In some situations, we are interested in the number of arrangements of only some of the elements of a set. Case III and Case IV address this particular situation. 8.1.3.3 Case III: Permutations of n objects taken r at a time (where \\(r\\leq n\\)) (WITH Replacement) Here the element is replaced in the set before the next element is chosen. Since there are \\(n\\) different ways to choose each element (repetitions are allowed), the product rule principle tells us that there are \\[n.n.n\\dots n = n^r\\] different ordered possibilities of size \\(r\\). Example 12: How many “three digit numbers” can be made with the four digits 3, 5, 7 and 8 (A digit can be used as much as you can) 8.1.3.4 Case IV: Permutations of n objects taken r at a time (where \\(r \\leq n\\)) (WITHOUT Replacement) Here the element is not replaced in the set before the next element is chosen. Thus, there are no repetitions in the ordered sample. Accordingly, an ordered sample of size $r4 without replacement is simply an \\(r\\) permutation of the elements in the set with \\(n\\) elements. In other words, by the product rule, the first element can be chosen in \\(n\\) ways, the second in \\((n-1)\\) ways, and so on \\[n.(n-1)(n-2)\\dots (n-r+1) = \\frac{n.(n-1)(n-2)\\dots (n-r+1).(n-r)!}{(n-r)!} = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} = ^nP_r\\] NOTE Consider the case that \\(n = r\\). we get \\[^nP_r=\\frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \\frac{n!}{0!} = \\frac{n!}{1}=n!\\] Example 13: How many “three digit numbers” can be made with the four digits 3, 5, 7 and 8 (without repetition) Example 14: A printed circuit board has eight different locations in which a component can be placed. If four different components are to be placed on the board, how many different designs are possible? 8.1.4 Combinations Another counting problem of interest is the number of subsets of \\(r\\) elements that can be selected from a set of \\(n\\) elements. These are called combinations. Here, order is not important. For example, the combinations of the letters a, b, c, d taken three at a time are \\(\\{a,b,c\\}, \\{a,b,d\\}, \\{a,c,d\\}, \\{b,c,d\\}\\) or simply \\(abc, abd, acd, bcd\\) Observe that the following combinations are equal: \\[abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba\\] That is, each denotes the same set \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\). The number of combinations of \\(n\\) objects taken \\(r\\) at a time will be denoted by \\(^nC_r\\). Before we derive the general formula for \\(^nC_r\\) , we consider a particular case. Example: Find the number of combinations of four objects a, b, c, d taken three at a time. Combinations Permutations \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\) \\(\\{a,b,d\\}\\) \\(\\{a,c,d\\}\\) \\(\\{b,c,d\\}\\) As can be seen in the above table, each combination consisting of three objects determines \\(3! = 6\\) permutations of the objects in the combination. Thus, the number of combinations multiplied by \\(3!\\) equals the number of permutations. That is, \\[^4C_3\\times 3! = ^4P_3\\] \\[^4C_3 = \\frac{^4P_3}{3!}\\] But we know \\(^4p_3 = \\frac{4!}{(4-3)!}=\\frac{4!}{1!} = 2.3.4 = 24\\) and \\(3!=6\\). Thus \\[^4C_3 = \\frac{24}{6} = 4\\] which is noted in the above table. Formula for \\(^nC_r\\) Since any combination of \\(n\\) objects taken \\(r\\) at a time determines \\(r!\\) permutations of the objects in the combination, we can conclude that \\[^nC_r\\times r! = ^nP_r.\\] Thus we obtain the following formula for \\(^nC_r\\) as \\[^nC_r\\times = \\frac{^nP_r}{r!} = \\frac{\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}}{r!} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.\\] Example 15: In a small company there are 8 executive managers. How many ways are there to select 3 executive managers to form a new committee? If Mr. Perera must be one of the 3, how many ways are there to form a new committee of 3? Example 16: A printed circuit board has eight different locations in which a component can be placed. If five identical components are to be placed on the board, how many different designs are possible? Example 17: In a small company there are 7 women and 5 men. A committee of 3 women and 2 men are to be selected. How many different possibilities are there to select a committee? Summary Sum Rule Principle: Suppose an event \\(E_1\\) can occur in \\(n_1\\) ways, a second event \\(E_2\\) can occur in \\(n_2\\) ways, a third event \\(E_3\\) can occur in \\(n_3\\) ways and so on, and suppose no two of the events can occur simultaneously (at the same time ). Then one of the events can occur in \\(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + \\dots\\) ways Product Rule Principle / Multiplication Rule Assume an operation can be described as a sequence of \\(k\\) steps, and - the number of ways of completing step 1 is \\(n_1\\), and - the number of ways of completing step 2 is \\(n_2\\) for each way of completing step 1, and - the number of ways of completing step 3 is \\(n_3\\) for each way of completing step 2, and so forth. The total number of ways of completing the operation is \\(n_1 \\times n_2 \\times \\dots \\times n_k\\) Permutations \\[n!\\quad\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\dots n_k!}\\quad\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad n^r\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad ^nP_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\] Number of combinations of \\(n\\) objects taken \\(r\\) at a time \\(( r \\leq n)\\) \\[^nC_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\] 8.2 Axioms of probability Probability of an event quantifies the uncertainty, randomness, or the possibility of occurrence the event. The probability of event E is usually denoted by \\(P(E)\\). Mathematically, the function \\(P(.)\\) is a set function defined from sample space \\((\\Omega)\\) to \\([0, 1]\\) interval, satisfying the following properties. These are called the ‘axioms of probability’. Axiom 1: For any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) \\geq 0\\) Axiom 2: \\(P(\\Omega) = 1\\) Axiom 3: If \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k\\) is a finite collection of mutually exclusive events, then \\[P(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup \\dots \\cup A_k)= \\sum_{i=1}^kP(A_i)\\] If \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\) is an infinite collection of mutually exclusive events, then \\[P(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup \\dots)= \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty P(A_i)\\] NOTE Axioms 1 and 2 imply that for any event \\(E\\), \\(0 \\leq P (E) \\leq 1\\). \\(P (E) = 1 \\iff\\) the event E is certain to occur. \\(P (E) = 0 \\iff\\) the event E cannot occur. 8.3 Methods for determining Probability There are several ways for determining the probability of events. Usually we use the following methods to obtain the probability of events. Classical method Relative frequency method (Empirical approach) Subjective method Using probability models 8.3.1 Classical Method In the classical method, the probability of an event is calculated based on the sample space. In this method no need to carry out any experiment. It is enough to know the sample space Let \\(E\\) be an event of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\). Suppose that the sample space is finite, and all the outcomes in the sample space are equally likely. Then, the probability of event \\(E\\) is given by \\[ P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes in E}}{\\text{Number of outcomes in } \\Omega} = \\frac{n(E)}{n(\\Omega)}\\] NOTE: For calculating probability using the classical method, knowledge on counting techniques is helpful. Activity 01 Consider the following problems. Is it possible to use the classical method to calculate the probabilities of the event interest in these problems? Calculate the probabilities using classical method if possible. A fair coin is tossed. What is the probability of getting a head? Two fair dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of two numbers is odd? A random sample of 4 products is taken from a production line. What is the probability that sample will contain more than 1 defective product? The carton of 12 eggs is randomly selected. What is the probability that carton will have more than 4 brown eggs? A one liter bottle of lemonade is selected randomly. What is the probability that the bottle will contain more than 900 ml? What is the probability that at least 1 call will come to my mobile phone during the lecture? Activity 02 A box contains 3 white balls and 2 black balls. Two balls are taken from this box. Write down the sample space Are the outcomes of your sample space equally likely? Can you write the sample space so that outcomes will be equally likely? Find the probability of getting one white ball and one black ball 8.3.2 Relative frequency method (Empirical or objective approach) Consider an experiment that can be repeatedly performed in an identical and independent fashion, and let \\(E\\) be an event consisting of a ﬁxed set of outcomes of the experiment. If the experiment is performed \\(k\\) times, on some of the replications the event \\(E\\) will occur, and on others, \\(E\\) will not occur. Let \\(freq (E)\\) be the number of replications on which \\(E\\) occurs. Then the ratio \\(\\frac{freq (E)}k\\) is called the relative frequency of event \\(E\\) in a sequence of \\(k\\) replications. Empirical evidence, based on the results of many such sequences of repeatable experiments, indicates that the relative frequency stabilizes as \\(k\\) is increased. This limiting relative frequency is equal to the probability of the event. That is, \\[P(E) = \\lim \\limits_{k \\to \\infty}\\frac{freq(E)}{k}....................(1)\\] Example A population contained an unknown proportion of defective items The following experiment was repeated: one item was selected randomly, and determined whether it was defective or not. An event \\(E\\) was defined to have occurred if the selected item was defective. The relative frequency of event \\(E\\) was calculated at each replication. The following figure shows that the relative frequency stabilizes around 0.3. Therefore, the probability of event \\(E\\) is 0.3. Therefore, the probability of an event \\(E\\) related to a random experiment can be interpreted as the \"approximate proportion of times that E occurs if we repeat the experiment very large number of times\". For example, the quality control engineer can say that the probability that a randomly selected product from his production process is defective with probability 0.3. It means that if we examine a very large number of products from his production process, the proportion of defective items will be approximately \\(30\\%\\). The relative frequency notion of probability given by eq. (1), is not practically applicable directly because in order to determine the probability we need to do the experiment inﬁnitely many times. However, as we can see from above graph the relative frequency is approximately equal to the limit when \\(k\\) is large enough. Therefore we can use the relative frequency notion to obtain an ‘estimate’ for the probability of the event \\(E\\). That is, if the number of trials, \\(k\\), is sufficiently large, then the observed relative frequency becomes close to the probability \\(P(E)\\), or \\[P(E) \\approx \\frac{\\text{Number of times the event E occurs}}{\\text{Number of trials}}= \\frac{freq(E)}{k}\\] This idea is used in practice, by using large data sets to estimate probability. Such probability is called empirical probability. This is also referred to as an objective approach because it depends on a property of the experiment rather than any particular individual concerned with the experiment. Activity 03 In a large manufacturing company, there are 2500 employees. An opinion survey was conducted on 960 randomly selected employees regarding three types of bonus schemes. Employees were divided into four categories, namely, laborers, clerical, technical and executives. The results obtained by ways of opinion survey are presented in the following table. Bonus scheme Laborer Clerk Technician Executive Total Type X 190 82 23 5 Type Y 243 44 78 12 Type Z 197 44 34 8 Total Let X be the event that a randomly selected employee with type X bonus scheme Y be the event that a randomly selected employee with type Y bonus scheme Z be the event that a randomly selected employee with type Z bonus scheme Let L be the event that a randomly selected employee is a Laborer C be the event that a randomly selected employee is a Clerk T be the event that a randomly selected employee is a Technician E be the event that a randomly selected employee is an Executive Then write the following events in words \\(C^\\prime\\) \\(C \\cap X\\) \\(L \\cup T\\) \\(C^\\prime \\cap Z\\) If a sample is selected at random, determine the following probabilities: \\(P(X)\\) \\(P(L)\\) \\(P(C^\\prime)\\) \\(P(C \\cap X)\\) \\(P( L \\cup T)\\) \\(P(C^\\prime \\cap Z)\\) 8.3.3 Subjective method A subjective probability reflects a person’s opinion about the likelihood of an event. These probabilities are personal and they will differ between people. Assigning subjective probabilities to events is hard as these guesses are often based on their personal experiences and evaluation of related facts. Subjective interpretation of probability is used for problems in which it is difficult to imagine a repetition of an experiment. These are ‘one shot’ situations. For example, A sports writer may say that the probability that Sri Lanka will win the next T20 World Cup is 0.6 A surgeon may guess that the probability of recovery after a heart surgery for certain person is about 0.5 A seismologist might say that there is an 80% probability that an earthquake will occur in a certain area One major shortcoming of subjective probability is that the probability of the same event can vary from person to person and the accuracy of these probabilities cannot be checked. 8.3.4 Using probability models In this method, the event of interest is expressed in terms of a “random variable” and the probability is calculated using a suitable mathematical function derived based on data. This method will be discussed later. 8.4 Conditional Probability Let \\(A\\) be an event of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) of an experiment. Then \\(P(A)\\) is called the unconditional probability or simply the probability of event \\(A\\). - Then, \\(P(A)\\) is equal to the sum of probability of each outcome in \\(A\\). Now suppose that the experiment has been carried out and we are told that the outcome is an element of another event \\(B\\) (But we are not told the exact outcome). In other words, we are told that event \\(B\\) has occurred. Then, what is the probability that event \\(A\\) has occurred? The probability of an event \\(A\\) occurring when it is known that some event \\(B\\) has occurred is called a conditional probability and is denoted by \\(P(A|B)\\). The symbol \\(P(A|B)\\) is usually read “the probability that A occurs given that B occurs” or simply “the probability of A, given B.” Activity 01 A box contains 3 white balls and 2 black balls. Two balls are taken one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that the first ball is white? If the first ball is white, what is the probability that the second ball is black? Show all the possible outcomes and probabilities of the above experiment in a tree diagram. Identify the unconditional probabilities and conditional probabilities from the given information. What is the probability that the second ball is black? Definition - Conditional Probability Let A and B be two events. The probability that event A occurs given that event B has occurred is called the conditional probability of A given B. It is denoted by \\(P(A|B)\\) and defined as \\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A ∩ B)}{P(B)}, \\text{ when }P(B) \\neq 0\\] 8.4.1 Independent events Two events A and B are said to be independent, if the occurrence of A does not depend on the occurrence of B. \\[\\text{A and B are independent} \\iff P(A|B) = P(A) \\text{ and } P(B|A) = P(B)\\] Activity 02 A box contains 3 white balls and 2 black balls. Two balls are taken one after the other with replacement. What is the probability that the first ball is white? If the first ball is white, what is the probability that the second ball is black? If the first ball is black, what is the probability that the second ball is black? What is the probability that the second ball is black? 8.5 Rules of Probability Probability rules are used for calculating the probabilities of events that are expressed in terms of other events with set operations. 8.5.1 Complement rule Let \\(E\\) be an event, Then \\(P(E^\\prime) = 1 –P(E)\\) 8.5.2 Addition rule Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two events. Then, \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A \\cap B)\\] If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive, then \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\) and, therefore, \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\] 8.5.3 Multiplication rule Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two events. Then, \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)\\] \\[\\text{A and B are independent } \\iff P(A|B) = P(A) \\text{ and } P(B|A) = P(B)\\] \\[\\text{A and B are independent} \\iff P(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B)\\] 8.5.4 The law of total probability \\[A_1\\cup A_2\\cup \\dots \\cup A_n = \\Omega, \\text{ all mutually disjoint}\\] Let \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots A_n\\) be mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Then, for any event \\(B\\), \\[P(B) = P(B \\cap A_1) + P(B \\cap A_2) + \\dots + P(B \\cap A_n)\\] \\[P(B) = P(B|A_1) P(A_1) + P(B|A_2) P(A_2) +\\dots+ P(B|A_n) P(A_n)\\] 8.6 Bayes’ Theorem Let \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots,A_n\\) be mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, and \\(B\\) be any event. Then for \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, n\\). \\[P(A_i|B) = \\frac{P(A_i \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] \\[P(A_i|B) = \\frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{P(B)}\\] 8.7 Tutorial Chapter 8: Probability Three cards are chosen in succession from a deck with 52 cards.

["random-variables.html", "Chapter 9 Random Variables 9.1 Types of Random Variables 9.2 Discrete Random Variable 9.3 Continuous Random Variable References", " Chapter 9 Random Variables Some sample spaces contain quantitative (numerical) outcomes, others contain qualitative outcomes. Often it is convenient to work with sample spaces containing numerical outcomes. A function that maps the original sample space into the real numbers is called a ‘random variable’. This is more useful when the original sample space contains qualitative outcomes. Definition 1: Random Variable Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a sample space. Let \\(X\\) be a function from \\(\\Omega\\) to \\(\\Re\\) (i.e. \\(X:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\Re\\)). Then \\(X\\) is called a random variable. A random variable assigns a real number to each outcome of a sample space. In other words, to each outcome of an experiment or a sample point \\(\\omega_i\\), of the sample spaces, there is a unique real number \\(x_i\\), known as the value of the random variable \\(X\\). The range of the random variable is called the induced sample space. A note on notation: Random variables will always denoted with uppercase letters and the realized values of the random variable (or its range) will be denoted by the corresponding lowercase letters. Thus, the random variable \\(X\\) can take the value \\(x\\). Each outcome of a sample space occurs with a certain probability. Therefore, each possible value of a random variable is associated with a probability. Any events of a sample space can be written in terms of a suitably defined random variable. 9.1 Types of Random Variables A random variable is of two types Discrete Random Variable Continuous Random Variable 9.2 Discrete Random Variable If the induced sample space is discrete, then the random variable is called a discrete random variable. Example 01 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. Express the following events using a suitably defined random variable \\(H=\\) The event of getting a head \\(T=\\) The event of getting a tail Example 02 Consider the experiment of rolling of a die. Express the following events using a suitably defined random variable \\(A=\\) The event that the number faced up is less than 5 \\(B=\\) The event that the number faced up is even \\(C=\\) The event that the number faced up is 2 or 5 Example 03 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin 10 times. Then the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) contains \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) outcomes. Each outcome is a sequence of 10 H’s and T’s. Express the following events in terms of a suitably defined random variable. \\(D=\\) The event that the number of heads is 5 \\(E=\\) The event that the number of tails is less than 4 9.3 Continuous Random Variable If the induced sample space is continuous, then the random variable is called a continuous random variable. Example 04 Consider the experiment of measuring the lifetime (in hours) of a randomly selected bulb. Express the following events in terms of a suitably defined random variable. \\(F=\\) The event that the lifetime is less than 300 hours \\(G=\\) The event that the lifetime is 1000 hours References Casella, G., &amp; Berger, R.

["correlation-and-regression.html", "Chapter 10 Correlation and Regression 10.1 Introduction to Correlation and Regression 10.2 Simple Linear Regression 10.3 Multiple Linear Regression References Tutorial", " Chapter 10 Correlation and Regression 10.1 Introduction to Correlation and Regression In many practical situations we want to identify various types of relationships between variables. Sometimes we want to estimate how one variable is related to or affected by some other variables. Regression analysis is a statistical technique for investigating and **modeling the relationship between variables*. There are numerous applications of regression in many fields. Examples - A production company may need to determine how its sales related to advertising - How the growth of the bacteria is related to moisture level of the environment. - The relationship between blood pressure and the age of a person. - the relationship between transaction time and transaction amount in fraud detection. Usually, the first step in regression analysis is to construct a scatter plot (or scatter matrix). Graphing the data in a scatter plot yields preliminary information about the shape and spread if the data. 10.1.0.1 Scatter plot A scatter plot is a two dimensional graph of pairs of points from two numerical variables In a quantitative bi-variate dataset, we have a \\((x,y)\\) pair for each sampling unit, where \\(x\\) denotes the independent variable and \\(y\\) denotes the dependent variable. Each \\((x,y)\\) pair can be considered as a point on the Cartesian plan. Scatter plot is a plot of all the \\((x,y)\\) pairs in the dataset. The purpose of scatter plot is to illustrate any relationship between two quantitative variables. If the variables are related, what kind of relationship it is, linear or nonlinear? If the relationship is linear, the scatter plot will show whether it is negative or positive. - The scatter plot gives some idea of how well a regression line fits the data. Example: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguin Data The palmerpenguins data (available through palmerpenguins R package) contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Penguin flipper length and body mass show a positive association for the 3 species. 10.1.0.2 Correlation Correlation is a measure of the degree of relatedness of two or more variables. Several measures of correlation are available , the selection of which depends mostly on the level of data being analysed. Ideally, researchers would like to calculate \\(\\rho\\), the population coefficient of correlation. However, because researchers virtually always deal with sample data, this section introduces a widely used sample coefficient of correlation, \\(r\\). This measure is applicable only if both variables being analysed have at least an interval level of data Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)) The statistic \\(r\\) is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, named after Karl Pearson (1857 - 1936). The tern \\(r\\) is a measure of the linear correlation of two variables. It is a number that ranges from -1 to 0 to +1, representing th strength of the linear relationship between the variables. An \\(r\\) value of \\(+1\\) denotes a perfect linear positive relationship between two variables. An \\(r\\) value of \\(-1\\) denotes a perfect linear negative relationship between two variables, which indicates an inverse relationship between two variables: as one variable gets larger, the other gets smaller. An \\(r\\) value of 0 means no linear relationship is present between the two variables. \\[ r = \\frac{\\sum(x-\\bar{x})(y-\\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x-\\bar{x})^2\\sum(y-\\bar{y})^2}}\\] \\[ r = \\frac{\\sum{xy} - \\frac{(\\sum x\\sum y)}{n}}{\\sqrt{[\\sum{x^2- \\frac{(\\sum{x})^2}{n}}][\\sum y^2-\\frac{(\\sum y)^2}{n}]}}\\] Examples: Following figure shows five different degrees of correlation: NOTE When \\(r=0\\), it signifies there is no linear relationship between the two variables. (There can be a non-linear relationship, Figure (e)) Figure (e): There is a very strong curvilinear relationship. But there is no linear relationship. 10.2 Simple Linear Regression The most elementary regression model is called simple linear regression. Is is also known as bivariate linear regression, which means that it involves only two variables. On variable is predicted by another variable. The variable to to be predicted is called the independent variable an is denoted by \\(y\\). The predictor is called the independent variable or explanatory variable and is denoted by \\(x\\) In simple linear regression analysis, only a strait-line relationship between two variables is examined. Nonlinear relationships and regression models with more than one independent variable can be explored by using multiple regression models. 10.2.1 Determining the equation of the regression line The first step in determining the equation of the regression line that passes through he sample data is to establish the equation’s form. In mathematics, the equation of a line can be written as \\[y=mx+c\\] where: \\(m\\) = slope of the line \\(c\\) = \\(y\\) intercept of the line. In statistics, the slope-intercept form of the equation of the regression line through the population points is: \\[\\hat{y} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x\\] where: \\(\\hat{y}\\) = the predicted value of \\(y\\) \\(\\beta_0\\) = the population \\(y\\) intercept \\(\\beta_1\\) = the population slope. For any specific dependent variable value, \\(y_i\\): \\[y_i = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i+\\epsilon_i\\] where: \\(x_i\\) = the value of the independent variable for the \\(i\\)th value \\(y_i\\) = the value of the dependent variable for the \\(i\\)th value \\(\\beta_0\\) = the population \\(y\\) intercept \\(\\beta_1\\) = the population slope \\(\\epsilon_i\\) = the error of prediction for the \\(i\\)th value. Unless the points being fitted by the regression equation are in perfect alignment, the regression line will miss at least some of the points. In the above equation, \\(\\epsilon_i\\) represents the error of the regression line in fitting these points. If a point is on the regression line, \\(\\epsilon_i = 0\\) 10.2.2 Deterministic models vs probabilistic models These mathematical models can be either deterministic models or probabilistic models. Deterministic models Deterministic models are mathematical models that produces an exact output for a given input For example, consider the equation of a regression line is: \\[\\hat{y} =1.68 + 2.40x\\]. For a value of \\(x=5,\\) the exact predicted value of \\(y\\) is \\[\\hat{y} =1.68 + 2.40\\times 5 = 13.68\\]. - However, the most of the time the values of \\(y\\) will not equal exactly the values yields by the equations. - Random error will occur in the prediction of the \\(y\\) values for values of \\(x\\), because it is likely that the variable \\(x\\) doe bot explain all the variability of the variable \\(y\\). Example Suppose we want to predict the sales volume (\\(y\\)) for a mobile phone company through regression analysis by using the annual amount of advertising (in Rupees) (\\(x\\)) as the predictor. Although sales are often related to advertising, there can be other factors related to sales that are not accounted for by the amount of advertising. Therefore, a regression model to predict sales volume by the amount of advertising probably involves some error. For this reason, in regression, we present the general model as a probabilistic model. Probabilistic models A probabilistic model is one that includes an error term that allows for the \\(y\\) values to vary for any given value of \\(x\\). The deterministic regression model is \\[y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x\\] The probabilistic regression model is \\[y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x+\\epsilon.\\] \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x\\) is the deterministic portion of the probabilistic model, \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x+\\epsilon.\\) In deterministic mode, all points are assumed to be on the line and in all cases \\(\\epsilon\\) is zero. 10.2.3 Least squares estimation of the parameters The parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are unknown and need to be estimated using sample data. The equation of the regression line contains the sample \\(y\\) intercept, \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\), and the sample slope, \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\). \\[\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0}+\\hat{\\beta_1}x\\] where: \\(\\hat{y}\\) = the predicted value of \\(y\\) \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) = the sample \\(y\\) intercept \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) = the sample slope To determine the equation of the regression line for a sample of data, the researcher must determine the values of \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}.\\) This process is sometimes referred to as least squares analysis. Least squares analysis is a process whereby a regression model is developed by producing the minimum sum of the squared error values. The least squares regression line is the regression line that results in the smallest sum of error squared. Least square analysis contd. 10.2.4 Residual analysis Each difference between the actual \\(y\\) values and the predicted \\(y\\) values is the error of the regression line at a given point, \\(y-\\hat{y},\\) and is referred to as the residual. Example Number of CD sales (’000) \\(x\\) Concert attendance (’000) \\(y\\) Predicted value \\(\\hat{y}\\) Residual \\(y-\\hat{y}\\) 61 4.280 63 4.080 67 4.420 69 4.170 70 4.480 74 4.300 76 4.820 81 4.700 86 5.110 91 5.130 95 5.640 97 5.560 Except for rounding error, the sum of the residuals is approximately zero The analysis of residuals plays an important role in validating the regression model. Residual analysis plots are a very useful tool for assessing aspects of accuracy of a linear regression model on a particular dataset and testing that the attributes of a dataset meet the requirements for linear regression. The following are the assumptions of simple linear regression analysis The model is linear. The error terms have constant variances. (The assumption of constant variance is called homoskedasticity. If the error variances are not constant, it is called heteroskedasticity.) The error terms are independent. The error terms are normally distributed. Four standard plots can be accessed using the plot() function in R with the fit variable once the model is generated. These can be used to show if there are problems with the dataset and the model produced that need to be considered in looking at the validity of the model. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = concert_attendance ~ record_sales) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) record_sales ## 1.5698 0.0407 Residual analysis 10.2.5 Coefficient of determination A widely used measure of fit for regression ,models is the coefficient of determination \\((R^2)\\) The coefficient of determination is the proportion of variability of the dependent variable (\\(y\\)) accounted for, or explained by, the independent variable (\\(x\\)) The coefficient of determination ranges from 0 to 1. An \\(R^2\\) of zero means that the predictor accounts for none of the variability of the dependent variable and that there is no regression prediction of \\(y\\) by \\(x\\). An \\(R^2\\) of 1 means perfect prediction of \\(y\\) by \\(x\\) and that \\(100\\%\\) of the variability of \\(y\\) is accounted for by \\(x\\) The dependent variable, \\(y\\), being predicted in a regression model has a variation that is measured by the total sum of squares of \\(y\\) (\\(SS_{yy}\\)): \\[SS_{yy} = \\sum(y-\\bar{y})^2= \\sum y^2 - \\frac{(\\sum y)^2}{n}\\] and is the sum of the squared deviations of the y values from the mean value of y. This variation can be broken into two additive variations: the explained variation, measure by the sum of squares of regression (\\(SSR\\)), and the unexplained variation, measured by the sum of squares of error (\\(SSE\\)). The relationship can be expressed in equation from as: \\[SS_{yy}=SSR+SSE\\] where \\(SSR = \\sum (\\hat{y} -\\bar{y})^2\\) and \\(SSE= \\sum (y-\\hat{y})^2\\). If each term in the equation is divided by \\(SS_{yy},\\) the resulting equation is: \\[1=\\frac{SSR}{SS{yy}}+ \\frac{SSE}{SS{yy}}.\\] The term \\(R^2\\) is the proportion of the \\(y\\) variability that is explained by the regression model and represented here as : \\[R^2= \\frac{SSR}{SS{yy}}.\\] Substituting this equation into the preceding relationship gives: \\[1=R^2+ \\frac{SSE}{SS{yy}}.\\] Solving for \\(R^2\\) gives \\[R^2=1- \\frac{SSE}{SS{yy}}= 1-\\frac{SSE}{\\sum{y^2}- \\frac{(\\sum y)^2}{n}}.\\] reg &lt;- lm(concert_attendance ~ record_sales) summary(reg) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = concert_attendance ~ record_sales) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.28171 -0.14938 0.04101 0.13162 0.22741 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The coefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\)) is the square of the coefficient of correlation \\[r = \\sqrt{R^2}\\] - The researcher must examine the sign of the slope of the regression line to determine whether a positive or negative relationship exists between the variables and then assign the same sign to the correlation value. r &lt;- cor(concert_attendance, record_sales) r^2 ## [1] 0.8990839 10.3 Multiple Linear Regression Multiple regression is an extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression that involves more than one explanatory variable. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable. Formula of Multiple Linear Regression \\[y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1+\\beta_2 x_2+\\beta_3 x_3+ \\dots + \\beta_k x_k+ \\epsilon\\] where \\(y =\\) the value of the dependent variable \\(\\beta_0 =\\) the regression constant, or intercept \\(\\beta_1 =\\) the partial regression coefficient for independent variable 1 \\(\\beta_2 =\\) the partial regression coefficient for independent variable 2 \\(\\beta_k =\\) the partial regression coefficient for independent variable k \\(k =\\) the number of independent variables.
