["number-systems.html", "Chapter 1 Number Systems 1.1 Main types 1.2 Number representations", " Chapter 1 Number Systems Numbers can be classified according to how they are represented or according to the properties that they have. 1.1 Main types 1.1.1 Complex numbers Every number in number system taken as a complex number A number of the form \\(a+ib\\) is called a complex number when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers and \\(i=\\sqrt{-1}\\). We call ‘\\(a\\)’ the real part and ‘\\(b\\)’ the imaginary part of the complex number \\(a+ib\\). IF \\(a=0\\) the number \\(ib\\) is said to be purely imaginary, if \\(b=0\\) the number \\(a\\) is real. A pair of complex number \\(a+ib\\) and \\(a-ib\\) are said to be conjugate of each other. Show that the sum and product of a complex number and its conjugate complex are both real. Let \\(x+iy\\) be a complex number and \\(x-iy\\) its conjugate complex. \\[Sum = (x+iy)+(x-iy) = 2x\\] \\[Product = (x+iy).(x-iy) = x^{2}+y^{2}\\] Let \\(a+ib\\) and \\(c+id\\) be two complex numbers. Then Addition. \\((a+ib) + (c+id)= (a+c)+i(b+d)\\) Subtraction \\((a+ib) - (c+id)= (a-c)+i(b-d)\\) Multiplication \\((a+ib) \\times (c+id)= ac-bd+i(ad+bc)\\) Addition. \\(\\frac{a+ib}{c+id}= \\frac{a+ib}{c+id}.\\frac{c-id}{c-id}= \\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}+i\\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}\\) Complex numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) 1.1.2 Imaginary numbers A number does not exist in the number line is called imaginary number. For example square root of negative numbers are imaginary numbers. It is denoted by \\(i\\). i.e \\[\\sqrt{-1}=i\\] \\[i^{2} = – 1\\] So there is no real number \\(i\\) that satisfies the above equation. The quantity \\(i\\) is called the unit imaginary number. Geometrical Representation of imaginary numbers Let OA be positive numbers which is represented by \\(x\\) and \\(OA^\\prime\\) by \\(-x\\) And \\(-x= (i)^2x=i(ix)\\) is on \\(OX^{\\prime}\\) It means that the multiplication of the real number \\(x\\) by \\(i\\) twice amounts to the rotation of OA through two right angles to reach \\(OA^\\prime\\). Thus, it means that multiplication of \\(x\\) by \\(i\\) is equivalent to the rotation of \\(x\\) through one right angle to reach \\(OA^{\\prime\\prime}\\). Hence, y-axis is known as imaginary axis. Multiplication by \\(i\\) rotates its direction through right angle. 1.1.3 Real numbers All numbers that can be represented on the number line are called real numbers. The real numbers is the set of numbers containing all of the rational numbers and all of the irrational numbers. The real numbers are “all the numbers” on the number line. Real Numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). 1.1.4 Rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) A rational number is defined as number of the form \\(x/y\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers and \\(y \\neq 0\\). i.e Any number which can be expressed as in the form of \\(p/q\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the integers and \\(q \\neq 0\\). The set of rational numbers encloses the set of integers and fractions. The rational numbers that are not integral will have decimal values. These values can be of two types Terminating decimal fractions (finite decimal factors): For example \\(1/5 = 0.5\\) , \\(13/5 = 2.6\\). Non Terminating decimal fractions : The non terminating decimal fractions having two types. Non terminating periodic fractions Non terminating non periodic fractions i) Non terminating periodic fractions These are non terminating decimal fractions of the type \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmb1b2b3b4b5 .....bm\\) Examples \\(19/6 = 3.16666666.....\\) \\(18/7 = 2.57142857142857.......\\) \\(21/9= 2.3333.......\\) ii) Non terminating non periodic fractions These are non terminating and there is no periodic decimal places for that number. i.e \\(a.b1b2b3b4b5 .....bmc1c2.........\\) for example 6.789542587436512………. So from above terminating and non terminating periodic fraction numbers belongs to rational numbers. 1.1.5 Irrational numbers Irrational numbers are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) An Irrational numbers are non terminating and non periodic fractions. i.e irrational number is a number that cannot be written as a ratio \\(x/y\\) form (or fraction). In decimal form, is never ends or repeats. Examples for irrational numbers are \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213......\\), \\(\\pi = 3.14159265.......\\), \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) etc. 1.1.6 Integers All numbers that do not having the decimal places in them are called integers. All whole numbers including Negative number + Positive number \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{...,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,...\\}\\) i.e the integer it may positive or negative or zero. The set of integers generally written \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)for short. Any integers are added, subtracted, or multiplied the result is always is an integer. When any integers multiplied , each of the multiplied integer is called a factor or divisor of the resulting product 1.1.7 Whole numbers The set of whole numbers means narrator numbers and \\(0\\) Whole numbers = \\(\\mathbb{W} = \\{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...\\}\\) 1.1.8 Natural numbers The counting numbers start with 1 and their end is not defined. Generally it is denoted by “N” i.e \\(\\mathbb{N} =\\{1,2,3,4,...\\}\\) Reading : Dass, H. K. (2008). ‘Complex Numbers’, Advanced Engineering Mathematics. S. Chand Publishing. pp. 474-520. 1.2 Number representations Decimal: The standard Hindu–Arabic numeral system using base ten. Binary: The base-two numeral system used by computers. Hexadecimal: Widely used by computer system designers and programmers, as they provide a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Octal: Occasionally used by computer system designers and programmers. Duodecimal: The most convenient numeral system, due to twelve’s divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}. Sexagesimal: Originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians (See positional notation for information on other bases) Roman numerals: The numeral system of ancient Rome, still occasionally used today. Tally marks: usually used for counting things that increase by small amounts and don’t change very quickly. Fractions: A representation of a non-integer as a ratio of two integers. These include improper fractions as well as mixed numbers. Continued fraction: An expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on. Scientific notation: A method for writing very small and very large numbers using powers of 10. When used in science, such a number also conveys the precision of measurement using significant figures. Knuth’s up-arrow notation, Conway chained arrow notation, and Bowers’s operators : Notations that allow the concise representation of some extremely large integers such as Graham’s number. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers https://byjus.com/maths/number-system/ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320677641_Number_System http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/resources/BinaryNumbers.pdf https://www.cs.bu.edu/courses/cs101a1/slides/CS101.Lect15.BinaryNumbers.ppt.pdf https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~ee314/handouts/numsys.pdf http://www.uobabylon.edu.iq/eprints/publication_3_8400_6187.pdf https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos217/lectures/03_NumberSystems.pdf Number system is used in IT applications Number Systems Rational, irrational numbers "],
["sequences-and-series.html", "Chapter 2 Sequences and Series 2.1 Sequences 2.2 Series", " Chapter 2 Sequences and Series 2.1 Sequences A Sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order: \\[a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, ..., a_{n}, ...\\] The number \\(a_{1}\\) is called the first term, \\(a_{2}\\) is the second term, and in general \\(a_{n}\\) is called the \\(n^{th}\\) term. We will deal exclusively with infinite sequences and so each term \\(a_{n}\\) will have a successor \\(a_{n+1}\\) Notice that for every positive integer \\(n\\) there is a corresponding number \\(a_{n}\\) and so a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. But we usually write \\(a_{n}\\) instead of the function notation \\(f(n)\\) for the value of the function at the number \\(n\\). Notation: The sequence \\(\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},...\\}\\) is also denoted by \\[\\{a_{n}\\}\\] or \\[\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\] Some sequences can be defined by giving a formula for the \\(n\\)th term. In the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequences: by using the preceding notation by using the defining formula by writing out the terms of the sequence Notice that \\(n\\) doesn’t have to start at 1. \\(\\{\\frac{n}{n+1}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = \\frac{n}{n+1}\\hspace{5em}\\{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5},..., \\frac{n}{n+1},... \\}\\) \\(\\{\\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = \\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}}\\hspace{5em}\\{-\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{3}{9}, -\\frac{4}{27}, \\frac{5}{81},..., \\frac{(-1)^n(n+1)}{3^{n}},... \\}\\) \\(\\{\\sqrt{n-3}\\}_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = \\sqrt{n-3}, n\\geq3\\hspace{5em}\\{0,1,\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3},..., \\sqrt{n-3},...\\}\\) \\(\\{cos\\frac{n\\pi}{6}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\hspace{5em} a_{n} = cos\\frac{n\\pi}{6}, n\\geq 0 \\hspace{5em}\\{1, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},\\frac{1}{2}, 0,...,cos\\frac{n\\pi}{6},...\\}\\) Example Find a formula for the general term \\(a_{n}\\) of the sequence \\[\\{\\frac{3}{5},-\\frac{4}{25}, \\frac{5}{125}, -\\frac{6}{625}, \\frac{7}{3125},...\\}\\] assuming that the pattern of the first few terms continues.

Eg: Student, household, farm, company, tomato plant iv Variable A variable is a feature characteristic which has different ‘values’ or categories for different elements (items/subjects/individuals) Eg: Gender of client, brand of mobile phones, risk level, number of emails received per day, age of client, income of client v Data Data are measurements or facts that are collected from a statistical unit/entity of interest We collect data on variables Data are raw numbers or facts that must be processed (analysed) to get useful information. We get information from data. Eg: Variable: Age (in years) of client Data: 21, 45, 18, 32, 30, 22, 23, 27 Information: The mean age is 27.25 years The minimum age is 18 years The range of ages is 18-45 The percentage of clients below 25 years of age: 50% vi Statistic Characteristic of a sample The value which calculated based on sample data vii Parameter Characteristic of a population The value which calculated based on population data viii Census When a researcher gathers data from the whole population for a given measurement, it is called a census ix Sampling When a researcher gathers data from a sample of the population for a given measurement, it is called sampling The process of selecting a sample is also called sampling Why take a sample instead of studying every member of the population ? Prohibitive cost of census Destruction of item being studied may be required Not possible to test or inspect all members of a population being studied. 6.1.2 Branches of Statistics i Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics consists of organizing, summarizing and presenting data in an informative way. The main purpose of descriptive statistics is to provide an overview of the data collected. Descriptive statistics describes the data collected through frequency tables, graphs and summary measures (mean, variance, quartiles, etc.). ii Inferential Statistics In inferential statistics sample data are used to draw inferences (i.e. derive conclusions) or make predictions about the populations from which the sample has been taken. This includes methods used to make decisions, estimates, predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample. This includes point estimations, interval estimation, test of hypotheses, regression analysis, time series analysis, multivariate analysis, etc. 6.1.3 Types of Variables 6.1.3.1 Qualitative / Quantitative Variables i Qualitative variable (Categorical variable) The characteristic is a quality. The data are categories. They cannot be given numerical values. However, it may be given a numerical label Qualitative variables are sometimes referred as categorical variables. Eg: Gender: Age group: Education level: A/L stream: Degree type: Hair colour: FIT student batch: Undergraduate level: Grade that you can obtain for CM 1110/ CM1130 ii Quantitative variable The characteristic is a quantity The data are numbers Quantitative data require numeric values that indicate how much or how many. They are obtained by counting or measuring with some scale Eg: Number of family members: Number of emails received per day: Weight of a student: Age: Credit balance in the SIM card: Time remaining in class: Temperature: Marks 6.1.3.2 Discrete/ Continuous Variables Quantitative variables can be classified as either discrete or continuous. i Discrete Variables Quantitative Usually the data are obtained by counting There are impossible values between any two possible values Eg: Number of family members: Number of emails received per day: ii Continuous Variables Quantitative Usually, the data are obtained by measuring with a scale There are no impossible values between any two possible values.(any value between any two possible values is also a possible value) i.e a continuous variable can take any value within a specified range. Eg: Weight of a student: Age: Credit balance in the SIM card: Time remaining in class: Temperature: Marks 6.1.4 Scales of Measurements There are four levels of measurements called, nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. Each levels has its own rules and restrictions Different levels of measurement contains different amount of information with respect to whatever the data are measuring i Nominal Scale Qualitative No order or ranking in categories. These categories have to be mutually exclusive, i.e. it should not be possible to place an individual or object in more than one category A name of a category can be substituted by a number, but it will be mere label and have no numerical meaning ii Ordinal Scale Qualitative Categories can be ordered or ranked A name of a category can be substituted by a number, but such a sequence does not indicate absolute quantities. Difference between any two numbers on the scale does not have a numerical meaningful. It cannot be assumed that the differences between adjacent numbers on the scale are equal. iii Interval Scale Quantitative Data can be ordered or ranked There is no absolute zero point. Zero is only an arbitrary point with which other values can compare Difference between two numbers is a meaningful numerical value Ration of two numbers is not a meaningful numerical value. iv Ratio Scale Quantitative Highest level of measurement There exist an absolute zero point (It has a true zero point) Ratio between different measurements is meaningful 6.2 Presentation of Data The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew 1 Here’s a quick summary of our variables: Variable Name Description PassengerID Passenger ID (just a row number, so obviously not useful for prediction) Survived Survived (1) or died (0) Pclass Passenger class (first, second or third) Name Passenger name Gender Passenger Gender Age Passenger age SibSp Number of siblings/spouses aboard Parch Number of parents/children aboard Ticket Ticket number Fare Fare Cabin Cabin Embarked Port of embarkation (S = Southampton, C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown) 6.2.1 Tabular Presentations of Data Raw Data Raw data are collected data that have not been organized numerically Eg: Passenger age ## PassengerId Survived Pclass ## 1 1 0 3 ## 2 2 1 1 ## 3 3 1 3 ## 4 4 1 1 ## 5 5 0 3 ## 6 6 0 3 ## Name Sex Age SibSp Parch ## 1 Braund, Mr. Owen Harris male 22 1 0 ## 2 Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer) female 38 1 0 ## 3 Heikkinen, Miss.

Examples: CASE I: Example 1 The native countries of 56 students from a certain education institute are as follows: ## [1] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;BD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;IN&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;BD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;IN&quot; ## [16] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;BD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; ## [31] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;PK&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;PK&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;PK&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;SL&quot; ## [46] &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;SL&quot; &quot;MD&quot; &quot;MD&quot; BD- Bangladesh, IN-India, MD-Maldives, PK-Pakistan, SL- Sri Lanka Construct a frequency table ## Native Country Count Percentage (%) ## Bangladesh 3 5.357 ## India 2 3.571 ## Maldives 5 8.929 ## Pakistan 3 5.357 ## Sri Lanka 43 76.786 ## Total 56 100.000 CASE II: Example 2 The grades of 30 students for Statistics are as follows: ## [1] &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [20] &quot;D&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; Construct a frequency table ## Grade Count Percentage (%) ## A 5 17.241 ## B 10 34.483 ## C 6 20.690 ## D 5 17.241 ## E 2 6.897 ## F 1 3.448 ## Total 29 100.000 CASE III: Example 3 The number of family members of a sample of undergraduates of Batch 19 are as follows: ## [1] 7 5 3 4 5 4 3 6 4 4 5 2 7 4 5 6 4 4 3 5 Construct a frequency table ## Number of family members Count Percentage (%) ## 2 1 5 ## 3 3 15 ## 4 7 35 ## 5 5 25 ## 6 2 10 ## 7 2 10 ## Total 20 100 CASE IV: Example 4 The ages (in years) of a sample of undergraduates of Batch 19 are as follows: ## [1] 21 22 22 23 22 24 24 23 21 22 23 22 22 23 21 21 22 23 22 23 Construct a frequency table ## Age (years) Count Percentage (%) ## 21 4 20 ## 22 8 40 ## 23 6 30 ## 24 2 10 ## Total 20 100 6.2.1.2 Grouped frequency distribution A grouped frequency distribution (table) is obtained by constructing classes (or intervals) for the data and then listing the corresponding number of values in each interval. Suitable for quantitative variables with large number of possible values in the range of data. Note that when items have been grouped in this way, their individual values are lost. When studying about frequency distributions it is very important to know the meaning of the following terms i Class intervals In a frequency distribution the total range of the observations are divided into a number of classes. Those are called class intervals Eg: Class intervals: 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, …, 40-44 ii Class limits Class limits are the smallest and largest piece of data value that can fall into a given class. In the class interval 10-14, the end numbers, 10 and 14, are called class limits The smaller number (10) is the lower class limit The larger number (14) is the upper class limit iii Class boundaries Class boundaries are obtained by adding the upper limit of one class interval to the lower limit of the next-higher class interval and dividing by 2. Class boundaries are also called True class limits Class boundaries should not coincide with actual observations Class interval Class boundaries 10 - 14 9.5 – 14.5 15 - 19 14.5 – 19.5 20 - 24 19.5 – 24.5 25 - 29 24.5 – 29.5 30 - 34 29.5 – 34.5 35 - 39 34.5 – 39.5 40 - 44 39.5 – 44.5 iv The size or width of a class interval The size or width of a class interval is the difference between the lower and upper class boundaries It is also referred to as the class width, class size, or class length Eg: The class width for the class 10-14 is = 14.5-9.5 = 5 v The class mark ( Midpoint of the class) Midpoint of the class Also called as class midpoint \\(\\text{Midpoint of the class} = \\frac{\\text{Lower limit} + \\text{Upper limit}}{2}\\) or \\(\\text{Midpoint of the class} = \\frac{\\text{Lower boundary} + \\text{Upper boundary}}{2}\\) vi Open class intervals A class interval that, at least theoretically, has either no upper class limit or no lower class limit indicated is called an open class interval For example, referring to age groups of individuals, the class interval “65 year and over” is an open class interval Rules and Practices for constructing grouped frequency tables Every data value should be in an interval The intervals should be mutually exclusive The classes of the distribution must be arrayed in size order. The number of classes not less than 5 or not greater than 15 is recommended. The following formula is often used to determine the number of classes: If n is the number of observations, then \\[\\text{Number of classes} = \\sqrt{n}\\] \\[\\text{Width of the class interval} = \\frac{Range}{\\sqrt{n}}= \\frac{Min-Max}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Data should be represented within classes having limits which the data can attain Classes should be continuous By convention, the beginning of the interval is given the appropriate exact value, rather than the end. Eg: intervals of 0-49, 50-99,100-149 would be preferred over the intervals 1-50, 51-100, 101-150 etc. The number f observations falling into each category or class interval (class frequency) can be easily found using tally marks. Examples: In a grouped frequency distribution, class intervals can be constructed in different ways Example 1 Class interval Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Example 2 Salary Number of employees 0 – 1999 1 2000 – 3999 31 4000 – 5999 18 6000 – 7999 4 8000 – 9999 2 10000 - 11999 1 12000 – 13999 0 14000 – 15999 0 16000 – 17999 1 18000 -19999 1 20000-21999 1 Salary Number of employees 0 – 1999 1 2000 – 3999 31 4000 – 5999 18 6000 – 7999 4 8000 – 9999 2 10000 - 15999 1 16000 – 21999 3 Total 60 Example 3 Salary Number of employees Less than 2000 1 2000 – 2999 11 3000 – 3999 20 4000 – 5999 18 6000 – 9999 6 Greater than or equal to 10000 4 Total 60 6.2.1.3 Two-way frequency table Cross tabulation, Cross classification table, Contingency table, Two-way table Display the relationship between two or more qualitative variables (categorical variables (nominal or ordinal)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## Survived First Second Third ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 died 80 97 372 ## 2 Survived 136 87 119 ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## Survived First Second Third ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 died 0.37 0.53 0.76 ## 2 Survived 0.63 0.47 0.24 6.2.2 Graphic Presentations of Data A diagram is a visual form for presentation of statistical data. The form of the diagram varies according to the nature of the data 6.2.2.1 Describing Qualitative Data Bar chart / Pie chart Suitable for Qualitative variables (nominal or ordinal) Discrete variables (when the number of bars or number of different values is small) I Bar Chart A bar graph uses bars to represent discrete categories of data It can be drawn either on horizontal (more common) or vertical base A rectangle of equal width is drawn for each category The height (in vertical bar chart) or the length (in horizontal bar chart) of the rectangle is equal to the category’s frequency or percentage. i Simple Bar Chart Only one categorical variable can be presented Often used in conjunction with simple frequency tables The bars do not touch each other The gaps between adjacent bars are same in length Passenger class Count Percentage First 216 24.242 Second 184 20.651 Third 491 55.107 ii Component Bar Chart Sub divided bar chart/ Stacked bar chart Use to compare two or more qualitative variables (nominal or ordinal) Often used in conjunction with two way tables Start by drawing a simple bar chart with the total figures. The bars are then divided into the component parts Can be drawn on absolute figures or percentages The various components should be kept in the same order in each bar To distinguish different components from one another, different colours or shades can be used Survived First Second Third died 80 97 372 Survived 136 87 119 Percentage component bar chart When sub-divided bar chart is drawn on percentage basis it is called percentage bar chart The various components are expressed as percentage to the total All bars are equal in height Survived First Second Third died 0.3703704 0.5271739 0.7576375 Survived 0.6296296 0.4728261 0.2423625 iii Multiple Bar Chart Compound bar chart/ Cluster bar chart Use to compare two or more qualitative variables (nominal or ordinal) Often used in conjunction with two way tables These bar charts are drawn side by side Survived First Second Third died 37.04 52.72 75.76 Survived 62.96 47.28 24.24 6.2.2.2 Describing Quantitative Data Histogram/ Dot plot / Box plot/ Scatter plot II Histogram Histogram looks similar to bar chart since it also has bars. However, it is different from a bar chart in a number of aspects. One main difference is that in the histogram, the bars are drawn attached to each other; there are no gaps between bars like in a bar chart. Histogram is used to show the shape of the distribution of a continuous variable. However, the histogram is also used for discrete variables when the data are grouped in to class intervals. In a histogram, the area of a bar should be proportional to the frequency of the corresponding class. If all the bars have the same width, then the height of a bar can represent the frequency. The bar corresponding to a class interval should be drawn from the lower class boundary to the upper class boundary. In this way there will be no gaps between the bars. Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a histogram for the data Marks Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Total 40 Example 2 III Frequency polygon If the mid-point of the top of each block in a histogram is joined by a straight line, a frequency polygon is produced. This is done under the assumption that the frequencies in a class-interval are evenly distributed throughout the class Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a frequency polygon for the data Marks Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Total 40 IV Frequency curve A frequency curve is drawn by smoothing the frequency polygon. It is smooth in such a way that the sharp turns are avoided Example: The marks(out of 50) of a group of students are recorded in the accompanying table. Draw a frequency curve for the data Marks Number of students 10 - 14 4 15 - 19 5 20 - 24 11 25 - 29 9 30 - 34 6 35 - 39 3 40 - 44 2 Total 40 frequency curves arising in practice take on certain characteristics shapes as shown bellow The symmetrical or bell shaped frequency curves are characterized by the fact that observations equidistant from the central maximum have the same frequency. An important example is the normal curve. In the moderately asymmetrical or skewed frequency curves the tail of the curve to one side of the central maximum is longer than that to the other. If the longer tail occurs to the right the curve is said to be skewed to the right or to have positive skewness.While if the reverse is true the curve is said to be skewed to the left or to have negative skewness. In a J shaped or reverse J shaped curve a maximum occurs at one end. A U shaped frequency curve has maxima at both ends. A bimodal frequency curve has two maxima. These appear as two distinct peaks (local maxima) in the frequency curve.When the two modes are unequal the larger mode is known as the major mode and the other as the minor mode. A multimodal frequency curve has more than two maxima. V Dot Plot A dot plot is a method of presenting data which gives a rough but rapid visual appreciation of the way in which the data are distributed It consists of a horizontal line marked out with divisions of the scale on which the variable is being measured -This graph can be used to represent only the numerical data. VI Box plot (Box and whisker plot) Box plot is also a useful method of representing the behavior of a data set or comparing two or more data sets. Box plot is constructed by identifying five statistics from the data set as largest value, smallest values, median, Q1 and Q3. Example: Construct a box plot for the following data set (Marks of students) \\[\\text{52, 88, 56, 79, 72, 91, 85, 88, 68, 63, 76, 73, 86, 95, 12, 69}\\] Xmin = 12 Xmax = 95 Q1 =64.25 Q2 = Median = 74.5 Q3 = 87.5 VII Violin plot A violin plot is a method of plotting quantitative data. It is similar to a box plot, with the addition of a rotated kernel density plot on each side. Violin plots are similar to box plots, except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values, usually smoothed by a kernel density estimator. 6.3 Summary Measures 6.3.1 Measures of Central Tendency Measure of central tendency yield information about the center, or middle part, of a group of numbers. Eg: Mode, Median, Arithmetic Mean, Geometric mean, Harmonic Mean, Quadratic Mean, Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles 6.3.1.1 Mode The Mode is the most frequently occuring value In a set of data Organizing the data into an ordered array (an ordering of the numbers from smallest to largest) helps to locate the mode. In the case of a tie for the most frequent occuring value, two modes are listed. Then the data are set to be bimodal If a set of data is not exactly bimodal but contains two values that are more dominant than others, some researchers take the liberty of referring to the data set as bimodal even without an exact tie for the mode. Data sets with more than two modes are referred to as multimodal. The mode is an appropriate measure of central tendency for nominal-level data. The mode can be used to determine which category occurs most frequently. Advantages and disadvantages of mode 6.3.1.2 Median The median is the middle value in an ordered array of numbers. Median divides the series into equal parts The following steps are used to determine the median. STEP 1: Arrange the observations in an ordered data array. STEP 2: For an odd number of terms, find the middle term of the ordered array. It is the median. STEP 3: For an even number of terms, find the arithmetic mean of the middle two terms. This arithmetic mean is the median. \\[Median = \\text{the }(\\frac{n+1}{2})\\text{th item in the data array} \\] The level of data measurement must be at least ordinal for a median to be meaningful. Advantages and disadvantages of median 6.3.1.3 Arithmetic Mean The arithmetic mean (usually called mean) is the sum of all observations divided by the total number of observations. Population Mean The poupulation mean us represented by the Greek letter \\(mu\\) (\\(\\mu\\)). Let, \\(N\\) is the number of terms in the population. \\[\\mu = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{N}=\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_N}{N}\\] Sample Mean The sample mean is represented by \\(\\bar{x}\\) Let, \\(n\\) is the number of terms in the sample \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{n}=\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_n}{n}\\] It is appropriate to use the mean to analyse data that are not at least interval level in measurement. Advantages and disadvantages of arithmetic mean Empirical relationship between mean, mode, median In case of symmetrical distribution, mean, median and mode coincide \\((mean = meadian= mode)\\) For a moderately asymmetrical distribution, the following relationship exists \\(Mean – Mode = 3(Mean - Median)\\) Choice between mean and median Mean is very sensitive to outliers.Median is not sensitive to outliers When there are outliers in a data set, median is more appropriate than mean 6.3.1.4 Quartiles, Deciles and Percentiles Median divides the data set into two equal parts. There are other values which divide the data set into a number of equal parts Those are Quartiles, Deciles and Percentiles (a) Quartiles (Q) – Quartiles divide an array into four equal parts \\[Q_i = \\text{the }\\frac{i}{4}(n+1)\\text{th item in the data array} \\] (b) Deciles (D) – Deciles divide an array into ten equal parts \\[D_i = \\text{the }\\frac{i}{10}(n+1)\\text{th item in the data array} \\] (c) Percentiles (P) – Percentiles divide an array into 100 equal parts \\[P_i = \\text{the }\\frac{i}{100}(n+1)\\text{th item in the data array} \\] 6.3.2 Measures of Variability Statistics that describe the spread or dispersion of a set of data. Measure of central tendency yield information about particular points of a data set. However, business researchers can use another group of analytic tools to describe a set of data. These tools are measures of variability, which describe the spread of the dispersion of a set of data. Using measures of variability in conjunction with measures of central tendency makes possible a more complete numerical description of the data. This section focuses on seven measures of variability for ungrouped data: range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, z score and coefficient of variation. 6.3.2.1 Range The range is the difference between the largest value of a data set and the smallest value. \\[Range = Maximum - Minimum\\] One important use of the range is in quality assurance, where the range is used to construct control charts Advantages and disadvantages of range 6.3.2.2 Interquartile Range (IQR) We use the interquartile range (IQR) to measure the spread of a data around the median (M). The interquartile range is the range of values between the first and third quartile. Essentially it is the range of the middle 50% of the data and is determined by computing the value of \\(Q_3 - Q_1\\). The interquartile range is especially useful in situations where data users are more interested in values towards the middle and less interested in extremes. The interquartile range is used in the construction of box and whisker plots. By eliminating the lowest 25% and the highest 25% of the items in a series, we are left with the central 50% , which are ordinarily free of extreme values. 6.3.2.3 Variance and Standard Deviation To measure the spread of data around the mean, we use the standard deviation (S). The variance and standard deviation are two very popular measures of dispersion. These measures are not meaningful unless the data are at least interval-level data. Their formulations are categorized into whether to evaluate from a population or from a sample. NOTE Sum of deviations from the arithmetic mean is always zero. \\[{\\sum{(x-\\mu)} = 0}\\] This property requires considering the alternative ways to obtain measure of variability. 6.3.2.3.1 Variane 6.3.2.3.2 Standard Deviation 6.3.3 Measures of Skewness and Kurtosis 6.3.4 Measures of Association References Black, K., Asafu-Adjaye, J., Khan, N., Perera, N., Edwards, P., &amp; Harris, M.
